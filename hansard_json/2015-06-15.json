      "spoken": "Thank you Madam Speaker, and welcome to everyone joining us in the gallery and online today. I first want to start by congratulating a Winnipeg swimmer, Chantal van Landeghem. She successfully won a gold medal at the Pan American Games yesterday in Toronto in the 100 metre free style, a sport I used to swim much faster in and her time, if swimmer just to take a look at her time, is absolutely outstanding so we do want to wish her and our athletes all the very best at the Pan American Games. Also want to send our thoughts and prayers to Maria Mitousis and all affected by the impact of the far reaching in inhering recent events in our city. I also want to, in that respect, thank all first responders for their exemplary, tireless and their quick efforts that undoubtedly saved lives including the members of our Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Service, the RCMP and of course, the Winnipeg Police Service. Winnipeggers appreciate your work each and every day on our behalf and especially in the last number of weeks. Had the opportunity with Councillor Mayes and Councillor Lukes to welcome our hometown hockey player, Jonathan Toews home. He brought back the Stanley Cup for the third time in six years. As members of this Chamber will know, Jonathan Toews is captain of the Chicago Blackhawks. He\u2019s also a captain of our community, too. He\u2019s renowned for his generosity, his charity and caring off the ice. He does work  in-home  in Winnipeg when he comes home and just worked with the Winnipeg Foundation on the \u201cnourishing potential\u201d campaign which is running now. And I would encourage Councillors and Winnipeggers to give to this important effort if they can. \u201cNourishing potential\u201d makes a positive impact in our community with our population growing. It's important that we empower and support our children and our youth to make healthy choices and to lead to our growing, striving and much more prosperous and healthy city. On June 17th, the City of Winnipeg honoured our indigenous employees with the celebration of National Aboriginal Day here in the courtyard of City Hall. I want to thank members of the Public Service so as members of Council who attended. Also, on June 17th, the Winnipeg Arts Council held the 9th Annual Mayor's Luncheon for the Arts, which I was pleased to attend. The luncheon celebrated and recognized some of the City's outstanding talented artists, recognizing champions for important contribution to the arts and cultural community, and I want to just\u2026I wanted to note this to let all those in our creative community know that this chamber and this Mayor support their efforts to continue to demonstrate their talents in our city. I also want to advise members of City Council that I had an opportunity to visit Shoal Lake recently, including a personal visit to Shoal Lake Band 40. I visited the Falcon Lake Canal Diversion Bridge which our Deputy Mayor was able to do the sod turning recently. As members of this chamber will know, the City of Winnipeg is funding 100 percent of the construction of a permanent bridge and we all are also, as active as possible on the important Freedom Road Project. Visiting the community was educational and certainly heightened my awareness of the acute issues that that community faces. Winnipeggers expect us to be respectable partners with the community that resides on the lake where we get our drinking water. And so, it was an important trip and hopefully not the last during my term, to Shoal Lake. We also celebrated the grand opening recently of Centrepoint, the development that incorporates historic Winnipeg with a growing, thriving and more modern city. Groups such as Stantec had moved downtown and we want to welcome them here downtown. That effort and that Centrepoint initiative will help continue to revitalize our downtown and bring more people, more jobs and vibrancy to the heart of our city. I want to recognize that thousands of Winnipeggers participated in the Canada Day Living Flag and also had the opportunity with I know members of Council to visit CanadInns\u2019 picnic at the park, at the Assiniboine Park at the Forks. And I know there were a number of initiatives and celebrations in various wards that Councillors attended in celebrating with\u2026celebrating our great country with the members of our community that we serve. I also want to recognize that Habitat for Humanity Home Build occurred a week or two ago. I want to thank Councillor Dobson for picking up a hammer with me and demonstrating some skills that he has and were on full display. I also donated with\u2026in partnership with the Chamber, $3,000 from my inaugural State of the City Address in support of Habitat. Recently, I attended the launch of the Take Pride Winnipeg Green Wave 2000 program at McKittrick Park and I want to thank all of the students who are literally cleaning up our city. They painted a number of things at that location and others across our community and I want to thank the efforts of everybody involved to help, essentially help beautify our community. The enhancement work really makes a positive impact on our community services. And, in advance of today's meeting, I know we\u2019ve got a lot in store today to discuss in this Chamber, I want to thank the Clerks, I want to thank members of this Council and Public Service for a productive session before we take a break over the course of the summer and I hope everybody has time during the prorogue to recharge their batteries and get ready to work for Winnipeggers when we return.

      "name": "Sarah Prowse",
      "spoken": "Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Good morning Mayor and Councillors and guests. Thank you for having me today. There was a written submission coming around as well, which I will refer to in my presentation. My name is Sarah Prowse with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. I am the manager of Physical Activity Promotion with Population and Public Health. As you may know, my colleague, Dr. Lisa Richards and I have been speaking in support of the Pedestrian Cycling Strategies as recently as last week to Executive Policy Committee. I am here again today because these strategies are fundamentally important for health. First of all, thank you City of Winnipeg for getting it right. Thank you for recognizing that\u2026and I quote from the strategies, \u201cequitable access to walking and cycling will improve personal mobility, promote healthy living, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the quality of life and community  well-being.\u201d  As Dr. Richards described last week and you will see in the written submission that is being July 15, 2015 provided to you right now, physical activity improves health through reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke, some types of cancers, Type 2 diabetes and improves mood and  well-being.  These strategies provide an opportunity to increase physical activity and reduce injuries through safe infrastructure. We know that health is determined and influenced by multiple factors. If we focus only on changing behaviour at an individual level, we will not create the level of impact we need to improve the health status of our population. The built environment influences our daily decisions to participate in physical activity whether we do that for active recreation or active transportation. We have engineered physical activity out of our daily lives and we are increasingly dependent on cars. And now, we have increasing rates of chronic disease and obesity, and this is costing us. Both in terms of direct health care costs but also indirect costs. Indirect costs are associated with the premature mortality and morbidity, shortened long term disability and the burden that\u2019s placed on our citizens and communities by our high rates of chronic disease and obesity. In 2012, the direct cost in Manitoba due to the health effects of just physical inactivity and excess weight are an estimated $350 million annually. The estimated indirect costs are $838 million annually. This is a total cost of $1.19 billion each year due to the effects of physical inactivity and excess weight. The health care system\u2019s mandate is to provide health care services. Generally we look after people when they are ill. The system treats illness and fixes injuries. It is the responsibility of all of us to create and protect health. The pedestrian cycling strategies are vital to providing access, supporting cohesion, providing choice, improving health, increasing health equity and most of all, will benefit all Winnipeggers. The strategies will provide access to school and to work, to the grocery store, to the park, to health care services, to pharmacies and other destinations on foot and on bike through connected networks of sidewalks and bike facilities. The strategy will support cohesion. When people are on foot or on bike they interact more with the people and places around them and increasing social connections creates an increased sense of community belonging and a vibrant and healthy city. The strategies will provide choice for active recreation and active transportation in a safe and enjoyable environment. Over one third of Winnipeggers are interested but concerned, who report they would cycle more if they felt safer. The strategies will benefit all Winnipeggers, everyone, all of us, no matter how we choose to get around, whether we walk, ride bikes or not. This is because increased active transportation decreases vehicle emissions, traffic congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and that's good for all of us. People who are connected to and feel happy about the neighbourhood that they live in are healthier and happier. And it will keep youth and young adults in our city. They want walkable, vibrant and healthy communities. The strategies will improve health even with small changes. Health gains are greatest when we can move someone from being inactive to somewhat or moderately active. So half the people in our city want to do a little bit more physical activity as what\u2019s documented in our strategies, the change could have tremendous impact. For example, an annual one percent reduction in physical inactivity for 20 years would reduce the indirect and direct costs of physical inactivity by $752 million. The strategies can increase health equity through improving access to destinations and increasing social inclusion for those in our lower socioeconomic populations. About one third of the people who currently cycle in Winnipeg have incomes of less than $40,000 per year. This population may not have the same choices that people in higher income groups do and they should be projected by being able to get where they need to more safely. So thank you again to the City for developing these strategies that have great potential to improve the health of our city. More people using active modes of transportation and participating in active recreation will help create a city that's connected, poised for sustainable growth and enhance the quality of life and health for all in Winnipeg.

      "name": "Mark Cohoe",
      "spoken": "Sure. So, it's my great pleasure to stand before you today in support of Winnipeg's first ever Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies. The strategy is a part of an ongoing commitment to proceed with the recommendations of Our Winnipeg and the transportation master plan which called for the development of the pedestrian and cycling strategies. As stated in the minutes of the November 2011 meeting, the past transportation master plan, a key underlying goal of the transportation plan is to expand the range of travel options that are available to residents, workers and visitors and to ensure that people are not dependent on one single mode of transportation. So basically, ensuring that we are giving people options as to how they get to their destinations whether they choose to walk, to bike or to drive or to take transit. It's important that they have those options available to them so they can make a decision they prefer. The strategies you see before you are the first step toward making that happen. They will act as a frame work that will help you guide but not dictate development of Winnipeg\u2019s walking and cycling networks over the next 20 years. They begin a process that will continue to engage residents, businesses and other stakeholders as strategies continue to evolve through neighbourhood level planning, corridor studies, precinct plans and various other capital projects. The strategies you see before you are the combination of more than two years of effort that engaged over 3,000 participants representing a variety and a balance of perspectives include over 600 telephone survey responses and a random survey of the City of Winnipeg, over 1600 on line responses, over 90 participants at a stakeholder workshop or 500 people participated in three open houses, including I think a significant amount of the dedication that some of the people are taking part in that showed over 300 completed open house questionnaires as they exited those open houses. And then there were approximately another 100 submissions that were filed through  e-mail  and over 160 responses to questions of the week that were provided as an opportunity to provide input into the strategies. So key messages that emerge from the public engagement process would ensure that sidewalks are maintained year round and that the cycling network provides a cohesive connected network of routes that provide direct access to destinations. A further key recommendation of the strategies include the set criteria to assist in the prioritization of projects that will be implemented in the short, medium and long term. Prioritization of the list of  short-term  projects will be open in the annual public engagement process facilitated through the active transportation advisory committee before being approved by Council. And this will add transparency to the process while allowing for continued evolution of both the walking and the cycling networks. So just to sum up, I can finish here. I just want to urge you to vote in favour of the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies and I certainly look forward to working with all Councillors in the community at large as Winnipeg continues on its journey to create a city where walking and biking are safe, convenient and comfortable options for all. So I would be happy to take any questions if you have any. ",

I know you were around in 2013, I believe it was in July, like myself, you were probably on your way to the Folk Festival, when you learned that the active transportation strategy that had already been started at a consultant that had been hired was abruptly cancelled without any public notice or notice to Councillors.

It came as a complete shock to myself and many others and I\u2019m sure completely shocked many who were on Council at the time as well. It was a process that was under way. It was engaged and took a fair bit of effort. Thanks to yourself and Councillor Orlikow to get that back on track. And I think what we see in front us today is the result of that effort, to move forward and I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s really going to benefit our city, to make sure that we have some planning, some vision to go forward as we try to provide those options to people as they travel to their destinations.

Now, one accusation we also heard is that it's just the bike lobby that is the only one who cares about this issue which is basically you represent the bike lobby, supposed if you want to use that to sort of negative term, which I don\u2019t. But could you describe who it is, who is the population of Winnipeg that has participated in this, beyond your own group.

    {
      "name": "Mark Cohoe",
      "spoken": "Absolutely. You know, certainly when you look at the participants who have been engaged in this, it's gone out to neighbourhood groups, it's gone out to the Councillors who have been involved who have been sending out newsletters to actively get people participating. It's something that's gone out through newsletters across the board. And when they have gone out, you know, we were asked to engage people in the community and certainly we did engage that. We engaged our membership and people through our lists, and the other stakeholders did that same commitment to getting\u2026making sure that they were providing information both forward and asking people to actually participate in the strategies as well. And it is really, I think, you know, certainly when we\u2019re looking at the people who are cycling, it's not just an elite community of cyclists plan and it's certainly also not simply a plan that asks to provide a cycling network that includes improvements to our pedestrian network that will help, you know, make them more accessible, bring them up to standards in many cases and in some cases, provide the first sidewalk on a street to give people that option to walk. And I think it really reflects both, you know, sort of an 8 to 80 kind of perspective. And, you know, whatever the specific public engagement processes are aimed at youth as well as I believe there is a seniors representative. There were representatives from the Access Advisory Committee, neighbourhood groups, business groups so it was a pretty wide participation. ",

      "name": "Councillor Gerbasi",
      "spoken": "And my final question has to do with infrastructure priorities and can you talk a bit about how cycling and walking infrastructure as compared to how much we\u2019ve invested in more car oriented infrastructure and how you see the balance between those two things? July 15, 2015 ",
      "type": "speaker"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mark Cohoe",
      "spoken": "Yeah. It's certainly something we\u2019ve been asking for for a long time, you know. We\u2019re dealing here with a strategy that's $334 million over 20 years. If we look at the four priority projects in the Building Canada Fund, it's $1.2 billion over ten years and that doesn't go to start including the significant plans for roadways expansion that's included within the transportation master plan, which again, goes into the billions. And, you know, I think the process that we have gone through here has been, you know, having been part of the stakeholder group on the transportation master plan and having been involved in that process, I can say that we went through a more significant public engagement process than this. Certainly I think if you look through it, we did get more people out and at a higher level of engagement. You know, on a percentage scale, we\u2019re talking about two to three percent of the total budget we have forecast going forward. I think that's the small price to pay to provide those healthy options for many people who don't have alternatives whether they are too young for a drivers licence or they\u2019ve made a choice to not drive as much or they\u2019ve made a choice to just have maybe one car in the family.

As you said, well if we did this, we move it a couple hundred meters so there are ways of dealing with some of the anomalies in this report. I think that\u2019s\u2026thank you for that. It was a report commissioned by the previous Council before this one as you pointed out. I just\u2026I think to give some credit where credit is due. Councillor Vandal was Chair of Public Works in July of 13 and went to bat to restate this so former Councillor Vandal helped get this up and running. But your comments in some ways that the forwards I wanted to get you to talk a bit about were guide, but not dictate and I think that's well said. What do you mean by that?

The idea is to sort of provide that neighbourhood level planning that can provide different options to people including the pros, the cons of those options, can move towards helping sort of prioritize items and assist in that prioritization, but ultimately, all decisions move up through the Council process and certainly the end decision making remains with Council. At the same time, you get to hear some of that public engagement, you get to go out and hear what people are talking about, where their barriers are, what they want to see move forward and I think it gives you a bit of\u2026a bit more to reflect on and a bit more information to make your ultimate decisions on.

There is a pretty significant bit of research that was done looking into the various conditions of the sidewalks, where sidewalks would need widening and where, for instance, we need\u2026we don't have any sidewalks on streets, we would need to fill in those gaps. And it looks as well at how to fund that, so it talks about having a budget item for local infill sidewalk which is something that was passed in this year's capital budget for the first time ever as well as looking at filling in the regional sidewalks. And it is one of the included cost estimates in that. And I think, you know, I was a bit surprised to see that the budget that was brought forth at the East Kildonan Transcona Committee meeting called for the removal of everything but the implementation, the $65 million that would be included through implementation of various other roadway projects which would, in a sense, remove that ability to create that infill on that regional sidewalks or at least made it much harder that\u2026to\u2026I guess, to validate and, you know, call for those additional monies to be spent in the future.

Mr. Mark, you know, when it comes down to local decision making, that's one thing, but it's difficult on central aspects and general aspects of this to deal with on a local level and certain things have to be done with Council. And ideally best while we are trying to implement which we are really trying to do, implement this plan as it gets through Council. So this is a hard part for us. As an example, in terms of central and overall planning, I would like to know why you think, through this consultation process, that $400,000 that ended up in this document that we are even considering through this consultation process, jeopardizing 95 percent of our current active transportation system which is our sidewalks. And, what that had to do with the consultation system\u2026consultation process you have. We need to deal with this centrally and not later on a local consultation level.

That is not a recommendation to actually implement that. That is a recommendation to consider that. This is a report that is coming before you, certainly, I imagine, consultants thought that was an important aspect. Perhaps they heard that through their public engagement process. I\u2019m not privy to the exact  decision-making  process that created this. You know, it is something that will go forward towards Council which is clearly stated in the strategies that any decision making process related to that, would go through a full public engagement process and then would be decided on by Council. I think it would also need to be initiated by Council. So it would be up to you. Certainly, I do feel the snow clearing policy is something that needs to be looked at and I think it's important to have something in the strategy saying that we do need to look at snow clearing policy because I know it's not what I would hope it to be.

      "spoken": "Well, the thing is, at this point, I was actually going to make sure I get clarification, Madam Speaker, because I think that I would have to amend the notice of motion\u2026the motion that I presented, given this new information that's being provided in this report, Madam Speaker. So as I speak to this, I welcome the Mayor to close on it, and then when we get to notice of motion I\u2019ll figure out how to amend it if it need be amended or withdrawn, Madam Speaker. So I\u2019m reading through this report, Madam Speaker, and at this point, I\u2019m not seeing\u2026I must have missed where it said that the auditor is actually hiring and overseeing the consulting company that will oversee these recommendations. In the report it talks about  --  it's interesting in this report, Madam Speaker, that it talks about at the time of our special meeting when Council hadn't even decided, and voted on following the recommendations in the real estate audit as presented by Ernst & Young, they were the ones who did the audit and I\u2019m reading in this report that somehow there were decisions made that go ahead from Property and Development, to go ahead and hire a company to help oversee them implement these recommendations as some expertise was lacking in our administration I think to accomplish some of those recommendations. Now, Madam Speaker, the will of the Council at the time was the direction that we took was to say that the auditor would issue RFPs. The Auditor would engage that\u2026choose the accountants, the company, partnership or whatever you want, that\u2019s won the RFP to oversee it and in there, there was a direction of course that Ernst & Young, because people at the time, Madam Speaker, you may recall, as I believe you were the Chari at the time, Madam Speaker, you might recall that there was a lot of questioning and concern that, you know, about audit companies and people having different perspectives. And so it called to not have, Madam Speaker, Ernst & Young be the external group to help us implement those recommendations, Madam Speaker. So, in this report I\u2019m not reading that\u2026there\u2019s no recommendation in here, Madam Speaker, there is no actual real explanation that I can find anywhere in this report that actually explains why our administration did not follow the will of Council, did not implement what we did and we passed as Council, was very clear and at the time that it was passed, I feel, Madam Speaker, that PD should, at that point, handed everything over because it was clear that the auditor was to undertake that. And in the report that came in January of this year, Madam Speaker, from the Audit Committee, EPC, I know it\u2026it noted in there, and it didn\u2019t\u2026and the auditor himself, who is no longer with us, indicated that he was consulted but he was not in control of the overall process July 15, 2015 there, and so, Madam Speaker, I don't know that this report is enough for me, and so\u2026but I would welcome to hear the Mayor's perspective on what this report means. We\u2019re accepting it as information. It sounds like some decisions have been made, so and I will proceed with the notice of motion once I get clarification. Thank you. ",

PPD has since issued an RFP to engage a third party to develop the real estate management framework that would address the majority of the recommendations. Now, since\u2026since 2014, the June 17th, 2015 meeting of Council, a notice of motion was given by Councillors Eadie and Wyatt to have the motion from the July 9th applied to the consultant that would be preparing the real estate management framework.

And it's a matter that may seem unimportant or curious in some ways, but it's important to remember we all as a group endorsed a few months ago, the efforts to try to keep the national volleyball team here. We have only one national sports team based in the City of Winnipeg. It\u2019s the women\u2019s volleyball team. We passed and then took some action and the CAO has come back with a very good report and I thank him for his efforts on this; recommending a waiver of fees and I would also like to thank Councillor Pagtakhan who\u2019s been a very steady and persistent champion of promoting this structure which is going to be not far from here, about Pacific and Main, about a block and a half from here. It will be a great initiative for downtown Winnipeg. As Chair of the Downtown, Heritage and Riverbank Management Committee, I think it's incumbent on me to stand this down and just say a few words about the project that is getting City, Provincial and Federal funding. It\u2019s going to be lynch pin for our Canada Games hosting. We\u2019re saying the excitement in an activity in Toronto area this week with the Pan Am Games and I think we will get our version of that in 2017 when we have the Canada Games. It may seem curious to be voting on something like this, but I will point out it's not in the report, but the Province is in for over a hundred thousand dollars each year subsidizing the volleyball team. That figure from the National volleyball folks, Greg Paseshnik and John Blacher who have provided a lot of information to us over the past couple of months. So the Province is in for over a hundred thousand dollars. Other Cities made pledges they would put forward money if they are able to lure the team away. The\u2026there is certainly advantage to promoting sports tourism and that's I think some of what we\u2019re doing here. It's also worth point out that\u2026it was estimated by Destination Winnipeg as it was then, that this hosting the volleyball team here generates over $2 million a year in gross economic activity, over $2 million a year in gross economic activity for the City of Winnipeg. Madam Speaker, later you\u2019ll be hearing a lot of talk and it will be good to talk about Parmalat and the jobs that are being saved here by our investment there. It's worth it to point out there are 17 jobs that are associated with this program and if we\u2019re able to can the program\u2026that\u2019s not the team members that\u2019s jobs associated with running the program here. If we\u2019re able to keep the program here, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than what we\u2019re putting in toward Parmalat, but I think it\u2019s a good use of our creative energies here to waive the fees to get what would really be a lynch pin tenant for this project, get in underway, a block and a half from here, right in the heart of downtown, we have a national team, promotes sports tourism, keep the jobs in Winnipeg and start building toward what should be I think $160 million economic activity that will be the Canada Games. So again, my thanks for\u2026to Councillor Pagtakhan for his work on this initiative. This came out of community centre\u2026no, Community Committee resolution a couple of weeks ago and some good work by the staff on this as well, bringing us this recommendations that we asked for a few months ago.

It does set a precedent and I can't recall one of this size in terms of the amount of dollars that have been now waived. I realize that it's a\u2026it\u2019s a great project. I realize that it's the national women's volleyball team. Their offices are here. Their headquarters are here.

Well, this is actually one of the areas you would diversify your revenue from\u2026is in permit fees and we are waiving them and, you know, I appreciate the fact that this organization is great organization, but I would also remind members of Council that we just\u2026we\u2019re in the process of building or built two new areas in the city and we did not waive the fees for that.

And part of the FCM election strategy is to call on all four parties to have a National leaders' debate on issues important to municipalities. And so they are asking municipalities large and small, across the country to approve resolutions and obviously it's July, the election could even be in October. That\u2019s why we\u2019re putting this here now and basically, I\u2019ll maybe read out the \u2018be it resolved\u2019, that Council endorse the FCM campaign and urges all Federal party leaders to participate in a debate on municipal issues such as infrastructure, transit, transportation and housing. And be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution shall be sent to the four main party leaders and to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. And I\u2019d also\u2026while I\u2019m talking about this, July 15, 2015 the whole strategy which we are endorsing is it's not just this, we also, on the debate, we really appreciate if people would sign the  on-line  petition that\u2019s a calling for elected officials to sign the  on-line  petition and members of the public as well and that you would like to see all four parties in a national debate, talking about issues important to communities. So I think this is a really good thing to see for our democracy and I\u2019d also like to highlight the FCM strategy on the election is something you really might want to take a look at. It's road map for strong cities and communities is what it's called and it's really, basically, showing the\u2026of all the Federal parties how communities and cities can play a role in improving our economy, improving our quality of life and solving the fiscal issues of the country through working together. So it's\u2026and it\u2019s dealing with the problems cities are facing like lack of funding for basic infrastructure, such as waste water, transit and housing and all of those issues. So it\u2019s\u2026the strategy is on line. I suggest you take look at it. I\u2019d like to thank Mayor Bowman who seconded the motion. I also would like to point out that Mayor Bowman attended the FCM meeting in June in Edmonton and didn't just pop in for a few minutes, he was there for three or four days meeting and working and connecting with people across Canada, promoting Winnipeg and working with the other Big City Mayors\u2019 on this which I think is really important, like Winnipeg is\u2026he\u2019s really boosting our presence and that it's a really good, Big City Mayors\u2019 group. There\u2019s also more effort from the Big City Mayors\u2019. There\u2019s now website and they\u2019re sort of parallel campaign they\u2019re working completely together with all of FCM which represents also a lot of rural communities. So we are all working together. The Big City Mayors\u2019 is strong and with the election coming federally, it's a really good time to get the attention. We\u2019ve already succeeded at getting in the budget from the current federal government, a permanent transit funding that was\u2026we\u2019re really pleased to get and we can continue to ask for all the parties to up that ante and do even more for public transit among many of the other issues. So that's all we are asking, is to support this campaign and sign the  on-line  petition, read the election platform and talk about it. There\u2019s other things individual Councillors can do. You can talk to your MPs about it. You can talk to your constituents about it as we move into the election and get the priorities of the communities across Canada including of course our own city on people's radar and talking about it. So that's the motion. Thank you, Madam Speaker. ",

It's very important that Canadians from coast to coast hear from our national leaders on their views on a whole range of municipal issues. Regardless of political strive, I think we have a really good opportunity right now to hear about some of the important programs that the various leaders are proposing. We\u2019ve seen, you know, things like the gas tax and Green Municipal Fund, which the Federal\u2026the Green Municipal Fund is a Federal Liberal project. We\u2019ve got now entrenched funding for the gas tax and there\u2019s a whole multitude of other important issues that are going to be dealt with through this campaign and I think it's very important that all national leaders get their voices heard on our municipal issues.

As has been noted by Councillor Browaty, this effort is nonpartisan. It is simply to bring all of the main parties together for a national debate. The City of Winnipeg is increasingly, thanks to the efforts of a number of people in this chamber, we are letting our voice be heard on a national level in a greater way than certainly in the past and my participation with FCM has really focused on getting a national discussion going with my counterparts on new funding models for cities, increasingly, the keys to 24 Sussex are through Canada's big Cities. Politically, times are changing as a greater number of seats and Canadians reside in our big Cities and so it really is incumbent upon all national parties to make sure that they have City\u2019s platforms, platforms that speak to the needs of Winnipeggers and others in other larger centres. And much of the issues that we deal with here are also being dealt with in other big Cities, housing, infrastructure as well as public transit, and so I\u2019m very pleased to second this motion.

      "spoken": "Speaker Gerbasi, I\u2019m actually going to be voting for this, to rescind this because there is no deal. But I just wanted to speak to this issue though in terms of why did we attempt a joint venture to develop some industrial\/commercial land, industrial land for business, so that we could compete with rural municipalities around us who are, and Centerport for that matter, out in Rosser, who are competing to attract businesses to the city and that's a very laudable thing for us as a city to do. I think it's important that we try to ensure that we have a base right here in Winnipeg that allows us to actually, you know, we\u2019ll have people, workers who pay taxes here in the City, help us to pay for fixing our roads, for example, and so on. But in doing this though, when you look at a joint venture, you have to evaluate risk. Risk is a real essential consideration in the development market. And, for example, right now in the housing market, Speaker Gerbasi, there\u2019s\u2026it's not quite as robust as it was over the last ten years and more. So if you\u2019re starting up a new development investing money, you are at a much higher risk at this point than the environment I...I\u2019m no expert in any of it necessarily, although I can understand the economics and economy and how things are moving forward but frankly, I don't really understand the industrial context in terms of development, assessment values, taxation and so on, a little bit off on it. But so I just wanted to say, in\u2026when we moved forward with this, what we were trying to do is balance the risk for the City in terms of being able to actually make some money that can be directed into doing better things for the City. So I\u2019m going to leave it at that. I am voting for the rescind obviously, the negotiations didn't come through and no signed contracts, so that's the way it is. But I think you really have to understand risk in the context of what we\u2019ll be hearing about as a fall out as a result of this. So I\u2019ll leave it at that, Speaker Gerbasi and I will be voting to rescind the motion we had to try to negotiate a joint venture. ",

      "name": "Councillor Wyatt",
      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I\u2019m rising to speak on this item. It's disappointing that we haven't been able to make this joint venture occur. The\u2026we were told that it's because one party has not agreed to sign the joint venture in relation to the fact that there was an interpretation of the\u2026I believe it\u2019s the Municipal Act that the joint venture has to pay property tax where in the past, joint ventures, because we are still 50 percent owners, have not. Joint ventures by their nature are a risk, but at the same time, they have worked well for the City. Most of our joint ventures have been in the area of developing residential developments where we have had contiguous land with the developer, in the City of Winnipeg that it made sense for us to enter into a joint venture. Where that developer would act as the manager of the joint venture and that, instead of selling our land as simply raw, undeveloped land, that we would be working as through a joint venture partnership of servicing that land, once that land is serviced, then selling that land as developed land, therefore, receiving proceeds which far outstripped what we would have received had we just simply sold the lowland unserviced. This has generated millions, literally, for the City of Winnipeg on the various joint ventures. This land in particular is quite interesting because this is the lands which are technically in the St. Boniface Ward, close to my ward, which are the historic lands of one decade ago, the debate on Olywest and the decision to move the hog plant on to these lands without any consultation with the community, and Madam Speaker, you remember that meeting very well in May of 2006. So just nine years ago, I guess, when this whole issue was very much hot and heavy before us. And it\u2026you know, it spoke to the whole issue of the need for a number of things, better public consultation, better involvement of the community, but also about the need for industrial lands in our city and in our province. Unfortunately, that need has not changed. We now have\u2026there is a huge need in terms of serviced, industrial employment lands inside the City of Winnipeg. That issue has not gone away. In fact, in many ways, it has gotten worse. We have seen in this last\u2026in that period since then, nine years, a growth of industrial lands in the surrounding municipalities around the City of Winnipeg. The RM of Springfield, the RM of Macdonald, the RM of West St. Paul and others, who have built industrial properties and literally, businesses which previously were located inside the City of Winnipeg, contributing to the City of Winnipeg mill rate or actually have moved out and are now contributing to other municipal mill rates simply because of the fact that they have industrial sized properties large enough to accommodate them, that have what they would call their level of services. The hope here was to do a joint venture with a reputable firm located on lands that they own just to the north of the site, they have continuous lands, a reputable firm which has done a number of projects with the City of Winnipeg, and delivered them on time, on budget, to name a few, the Chief Peguis Trail, delivered on time, on budget and in only a year. The Public Works Yard, delivered on time and on budget on Thomas Avenue in Elmwood. The Charleswood Bridge, built many years ago. And this firm came forward and said look, why don't we work together and put forward a proposal where we could compete with the other municipalities around the city in terms of the level of services and to the price of land and to develop these 200 plus acres. There is another clause coming forward on the agenda, which I don't want to confuse or speak to because that's a separate clause, but the issue here is the lost opportunity because no matter what we do with the other clause, the fact is the remaining 100 some\u2026nearly 180 acres will remain probably undeveloped for the foreseeable future. The benefit of having a private sector partner is to be able to market and have that private sector partner have the ability, the  in-house  ability to market and to sell. We already know already of one other private sector entity that wanted to move into this industrial park that has contacted the CAO, the Mayor and some members of Council, TEAMS Transport, larger actually than Parmalat, 140 employees and they had interest in 10 acres of land in this industrial park. Again, a tenant, a purchaser that was secured through the work of our\u2026what we were hoping would be our joint venture partner. It's unfortunate though that we were not able to make it work and I really don't understand why it was not able to come together considering now the contents of the next report, in light of the fact that the Province was prepared to kickback, to give back their education taxes for one, for us to develop a small section of the property, verses where had we had the same proviso in place for this, we could have been in a position, Madam Speaker, to be able to go forward and foreseeably implement the joint venture which was a 16 year business plan to develop this entire site. This site has sat foul, grass, grass up to your knees, Madam Speaker, since Unicity and my fear is that with\u2026I\u2019m glad to see that Parmalat is still staying, but with the Parmalat development and maybe hopefully the TEAMS Development, the balance of the lands though, the marketing and the sale of the balance the lands that these lands, some 170, 180 acres will sit and not contribute anything to the tax base. The risk here, I guess what I\u2019m saying, Madam Speaker, was minimal compared to what could have been the benefit to the new taxes coming on the tax roll, had we proceeded it with this development, with this joint venture. And so it\u2019s really, it was sadness that I speak to this clause, because I think opportunities like this don't come along that often. I hope that the Public Service does not simply stop at the Parmalat and pursues the TEAMS project, but also pursues potentially another EOI, maybe through another EOI, another expression of interest. The opportunity for a joint venture on the balance of the lands so that we can make those lands productive. The fact of the matter is we are losing our industries to other municipalities. The fact of the matter is we know that there are other cities now in western Canada, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton, who have industrial lands available that we are competing with whether we like it or not that we could lose industries to it because of the fact we do not have available, serviceable, industrial lands. And so that\u2026 ",

Again, this has\u2026this deal has been in the works for quite some time and they\u2019re trying to get a joint venture signed. I just want to state about the larger conversation about industrial lands inside Winnipeg. There was a lot of pressure upon myself recently about how do we develop industrial lands within the City of Winnipeg. One of my comments is that Winnipeg itself has inherent strength that rural municipalities don't. We have a labour force. We have a large water supply. We have a large sewer supply. So we attract industrial lands and customers that would be attracted to those assets. I am not interested as a City Council and I don't think we\u2019re interested in residential properties to be there. It\u2019s a lower development standards to a point where we\u2019re doing gravel roads, open culverts, to try to match one for one with the Rural Municipalities. They have their assets out there. They can have lower design standards, much lower design standards. Through this joint venture, we were able, well, we may or may not have been able to come\u2026we are closer to a point where it made some more sense for Terracon and the City, but there is a point when the City of Winnipeg has to say, we do have standards; we do have standards. So we can't just throw all those standards out the window just because we want to facilitate a lower standard industrial park. We need to be open. We need to consider what the developers are bringing forward. But again, the City of Winnipeg has these assets. So we are going to be attracting businesses such as Parmalat that needs lots of water. Municipalities can't do that. They need sewer capacity. They need certain things. They need transportation links, some other groups need. So that\u2019s\u2026so I\u2019m not here to sell Winnipeg out for the cheap, I\u2019m here to make sure Winnipeg gets those industrial lands develop at a standard that is\u2026has a balance to it, but I\u2019m not looking at developing industrial lands in the City of Winnipeg on a rural standard. And I just want to add a comment to Councillor Eadie and thank you Councillor Eadie for mentioning the question of risk. The previous Council and the Executive Policy Committee, to some people's view and mine included had a very high tolerance for more risk. Take lots of risk because it's a slam dunk. So you can't miss on this one. How many times did we hear that? Again, things aren't a slam dunk. So we can go out there and, you know, scare the public and say, this won\u2019t, won\u2019t or won't happen, will happen. But again, we can't\u2026we have to do it both sides. We can\u2019t say that we\u2019re going to develop all these lands just because we are here and we hope it will come. Again, we have a fiscal situation right now in the City of Winnipeg that we have to be very careful about how much risk we do take. We have to make sure that the issues that are addressing for the City of Winnipeg or the City of Winnipeg issues, i.e. property taxes, water taxes, the revenue streams and then. We do want to care about the jobs, we want to care about other factors but again, our issue is does it make fiscal sense for the City of Winnipeg as well as the other developers? So there\u2019s two parties negotiating. And in this case, Terracon as we negotiated for quite some time. Again unfortunately, the last Council wasn't able to include a deal. However, in the short period of time that we\u2019ve been here and again I want to thank our public administration for spending an astronomical amount of time trying to make this thing work, this inherited issue. In the end of the day, Terracon decided that it\u2019s just the risk was too high for them. So the idea that some Councillors are alluding to that we should\u2019ve dumped more money into it to make it happen, again that increases our risk on our side. And again, the risk, Terracon is now going to go forward, why should the City\u2019s also going to take on more risk? Well again, we have to balance our risk threshold and I say, after that last couple of years in the Council where some of those risks have not turned out too well for us. We have to be much more pragmatic when we\u2019re assessing our risk. So I want to make that known and also I don't believe it's the intention unless Council of course who has previously decides otherwise to lower our industrial lands to a standard that is equal or even less than rural municipalities.

I do believe that the TEAMS project is a great project. I believe it is. I would love to be able to vote for the report, but I\u2019m not voting for it not because of the fact that these are not great projects, not because of the fact that I don't support the employees that are here today. I think it\u2019s important, but rather because of the fact of our process here that this report was literally walked on that I have not had a chance to read this fully and understand exactly what we are voting on. And I have a hard time believing that the special meeting on July the 6th called at Property and Development to hear the matter that we just decided on with regards to cancelling the joint venture with Terracon that at that point that this was not known and that this was the other shoe that was going to fall and why was that this not brought forward at that time? Instead, it has been brought forward the day before a Council seminar is called at 2:00 o'clock on a Tuesday, for the Council\u2026for the Standing Committee meeting at P and D on...at 3:00 o'clock on the Tuesday and that this\u2026that meeting was called the day before at about 4:30, 5:00 o'clock, not even 24 hours of notice of the meeting and now we are being asked to vote on  multi-million  dollar\u2026millions of dollars to be going out of our LOR into I think\u2026I\u2019m\u2026and again, Parmalat, wonderful project, we have to keep them, but I believe that the Public Service and the Executive Policy Committee do not want to repeat mistakes of the past. I believe that's their intent. But they are repeating now the mistakes of the past by jamming Council and by ramming through, by not respecting due process, by expecting Councillors to vote on reports that they have not had a chance to read or to understand or to ask questions of. Now, there is nothing wrong with this report, I\u2019m assuming. And if there isn't anything wrong with this report, why is it being rushed? Why? Now, I understand Parmalat has to get going, has to get moving. But you know what, we could\u2019ve had a briefing on this two weeks ago. The CAO admitted yesterday in the Property and Development meeting that he was aware that the Terracon deal was not going to go through approximately two weeks ago, that something had to be happened. There could have been emergency briefing, confidential briefing of all members of Council at that time to bring us up to speed. That was not done. And yet, now we\u2019re being asked to vote millions of dollars. Now, it\u2019s great that the Minister across the way on Broadway knew about this weeks before this Council knew that it was taking money out of its LOR to make this deal whole. So we\u2019re bailing out Broadway without knowing exactly what we\u2019re doing here at City Hall. So, I want to support this because of what\u2019s\u2026the employees and everything and they have my support, and their project has my support, but we have to respect the process here before us and you know what, there might be a lot of feelings of the past especially Councillors who were here in the previous July 15, 2015 term and they might argue two wrongs make a right. I like\u2026that might be a case they can make. But I don't believe that two wrongs make a right. And if it's truly about a new agenda and a new way of doing business, this is not the way of doing it. We\u2019re all here to help, I\u2019d like to think. We all want to contribute and do the right thing for the good of our city. We all have\u2026we all bring something to the table in terms of our own experiences, in terms of our own backgrounds. We all want to contribute productively. I really believe that. And I believe that given the opportunity, that can occur. But this is an example where that opportunity is again not being allowed to happen and is lost. So, it's a symbolic vote to vote against it, but it's also ridiculous because of the fact that the project, Parmalat is an important project to this city. We want to maintain Parmalat in this city. We want to ensure Parmalat stays in Winnipeg and Manitoba. We want to ensure that they could\u2026they are good jobs,  well-paying  jobs that they can actually, not only maintain the jobs they have, but expand and the same goes with TEAM. When I spoke to the proprietor, the managing operator of TEAMS on the weekend and the other day, TEAM Transport, he, too was frustrated. He\u2019s happy and hopeful that with this, the City will now move forward and work with him and his firm on making lands available, hopefully at the same price that he was offered or he made an offer on in terms of the lands, that he is looking for 10 acres to secure his firm to stay in Winnipeg. They have offices out west as well, and warehouses out west, and they\u2019ve also looked at facilities in Regina in the event that they can't secure anything here in Winnipeg. They\u2019re looking at 10 acres of land. But he, too, expressed frustration that once again, we have to as a city and as government bailed us out verses working with a private sector department where our risk could have been spread. Nonetheless, we\u2019ve had that debate, and now we\u2019re debating this. My concern, Madam Speaker, is the fact that this has been brought forward in the summer, again, typical of the summer and I have, Madam Speaker, in previous Council stood up and spoken against reports rammed through in the middle of summer, even as the chair of a standing committee, where reports that were forced on to my standing committee and fought them and politically paid the price of being thrown off EPC for not allowing reports like this to go forward in this manner or for opposing them. So you know what, I\u2019ve spoken about it in the past. I\u2019m speaking about it now. I believe I have been consistent and unfortunately, here we are again today, in July, with a report being jammed through. For that reason, I\u2019m not supporting it. I want to emphasize that for that reason, I\u2019m not supporting it, not for the reason that I think that the Parmalat jobs are not\u2026and that or that I don't want it to go forward. I want it to go forward, but for the reason that due process is not being respected and that members of Council are not being informed including some members on the east side of the City where this plant has been actually located.

      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. Actually, I am quite concerned how fast this is moving. Of course, we all have been working on many other items. There is a long list of reports actually on here and it is coming down fast. And actually, I want to hear some stuff before I make my final vote, but I definitely support Parmalat moving forward. As I mentioned under the previous report, I think it's really, really important that we are able to attract and keep business here in this City of Winnipeg. It's for the best of everybody in the city and I think it\u2019s good and in that, this part of the report I think that\u2019s very important. I\u2019m not sure, of course, TEAMS is probably not part of this particular vote and not sure if that, as we proceed that, that\u2019s going to cost us some money from some fund to help accommodate that business that needs 10 acres. But you know, for me, and because I haven't had time to really synthesize everything here, I think that really, there needs to be a risk analysis if we\u2019re moving forward in just doing this ourselves, just to portray that and I know our administration, we have a\u2026I know our new CAO who is more than qualified to deal with these kind of issues, I\u2019m sure. And basically, what we are doing is relying on the recommendations of that person, of our CAO and through the Mayor and the\u2026so and, well, P&D as well so but really, at some point, I think this land, if we\u2019re proceeding this way and it's the City of Winnipeg that's going to be marketing and promoting this industrial property, I think that you really need to do a real serious risk analysis. You can't just say, you know, we\u2019re going to develop it, the acreage will be worth this much money and usually, you don't make your money back till you sold off the last piece of acreage and in doing that development. I don't know how detailed this report is, Councillor Orlikow, in terms of how much of the local industrial development will have to be done in order to accommodate Parmalat and hopefully TEAMS and that can be worked out. So there\u2019s all these factors that, you know, really, we\u2019re being asked at the last moment to decide on, but and I\u2019 just\u2026I\u2019m going to listen to hear, maybe somebody can explain to me, this sounds like it\u2019s just regards to Parmalat but I\u2019d like to hear how we are proceeding in terms of dealing with TEAMS and for that matter, how we would be proceeding with some of the developments. So I\u2019d like to hear that in this discussion, this debate because frankly, a quick conversation that I had two minute\u2026for two minutes last evening is not enough for me to say, well, let's take a risk. What is the real risk? And was mentioned that there was a lot of risk taken through the last Council term and reports and things that moved along and frankly, the risks are moving higher in this particular economic environment. There\u2019s a concern. Only a number of months ago, I heard about Manitoba performing super well. And now, I\u2019m hearing that well, there is a lot of concern, could be big trouble. There\u2019s been a downgrade in our\u2026was just in the news. There\u2019s been a downgrade in our debt rating. So we have gone down. We followed with the Province. I understand what it is, but, you know, higher interest rates do reflect risk. And if higher interest rates are there, that means there\u2019s risks so anyway, I\u2019ll leave it at that. I\u2026Madam Speaker, I will more than likely be voting for this because I think this is very important, but I really have to say, you know, actually, we are looking at other reports that are over 300 pages and we\u2019re\u2026like if you don't understand all the details and nuances inside it, like\u2026and you are moving it forward, you know, I am really concerned about that. So I am really concerned that I\u2019m going to make a decision here and I don't really know what the risks are for the City of Winnipeg into the future, because Madam Speaker, I do have a responsibility not just for what is happening in my ward, but that the City of Winnipeg is able to be viable and a great place to live. So, I\u2019ll leave it at that, Madam Speaker and I\u2019ll make my final decision when I hear the clause. I\u2019d like some of my concerns addressed when I\u2026when it's closed. Thank you. ",

      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I don't think any of us like to see walk on items, they\u2019re\u2026they\u2019re difficult. But I would point out in this process that there was a very good reason for this to be walked on which was explained to us at the Council seminar that unfortunately, Councillor Wyatt didn't attend and Councillor Eadie, I assume they were not able to attend. But my understanding and what was explained to us by the CAO was that the reason it was last minute and there\u2019s a very legitimate reason, is that it was only the day before that they concluded the negotiations and then the report was written and put together and gotten to us in time for a Council seminar and in time to actually have a special meeting of the Standing Committee. It wasn't just walked on to the floor of Council which we\u2019ve seen in the past. It wasn\u2019t walked on to the floor of Council. It went through the proper committee process and there was a Council seminar prior so all members of Council could be walked through all the details with the CAO and the Mayor and that is a better process than some of these situations we\u2019ve gotten into where it was just appeared on the floor of Council and there was no chance to ask questions of the administration. We were given a chance to ask questions of the seminar. We were told we could call him at any time and follow up with those questions. So anyway, you know, we were given that opportunity. And I think to put this in perspective; this is a good news story. We had a problem. We had an industry that was really wanted to come to Winnipeg with jobs and we have supporters in the audience who are pretty pleased about this. We had a problem and the Administration and the Mayor went out and basically solved it really quickly. You know, sometimes doing things fast is a good thing if you solve a problem and it\u2019s successful and it\u2019s good for the city. That's what we are talking about here. And there is no conspiracy. Generally, our CAO was tasked with solving this problem and working with the Province. The Province is focused on jobs in the industry. They didn't want to lose that industry. They came to the table in a way that they wouldn't have come to before. So we took advantage of that. This Council is levering a lot more resources not only from the Province, but also from the industry. They put in a bigger chunk of this. So our risk, and I can totally understand, be concerned about it. We all are, but our risk is the worst case scenario which is what the report presents. It\u2019s the most we could absolutely be stuck with is $2 million, if no one else and nothing else succeeds. But that will be paid back in the tax increment and financing type of arrangement over 18 years. So that\u2019s the worst case scenario. But we know we already have another, at least one, possibly more interested parties and the land instead of being worth 8100 an acre is worth 175 dollars an acre, what we\u2019re getting for it. And all this land is going to be worth more and we already have two or three interested parties, so it\u2019s already looking better than the worst case scenario that was honestly and with a conservative estimate presented to us. So I think it's a good news story. I think we should thank our administration when they solve problems quickly and effectively and bringing\u2026levering money from other levels of government and the private sector to reduce our risk as a city. That's what happened here today. So I don't really see a down side of the joint venture didn't happen. That came also through a completely appropriate process. I\u2019m on the Property and Development Committee. We discussed it, we were given the information as to why. There is a very good reason why and it has also to do with reducing our risk. It wasn't a good deal for us to do that joint venture. And the partner didn't want to participate and they didn't want to take on their fair share of the risk in my view, but it also just didn't work. And this approach, I also want to add one more thing, is that it also is in the report which was explained to us at the seminar, that the administration is going to go back after we quickly solve this issue, we\u2019ve saved an industry. We\u2019ve solved a problem and they\u2019re going to come back within a year. It says right in the\u2026in one of the recommendations here. They\u2019re going to come back within a year with different approaches to marketing the rest of the land and how we\u2019re going to deal with all of that. So they haven't got all of the answers in front us today about completely solving every problem, but they solved an important one today, and they\u2019re going to bring back to the proper process with the Committees and Council to decide. Maybe we will go into another joint venture, maybe we will market it a different way. Maybe the people will just come and buy the land now that there is some servicing and there\u2019s other things happening there. We\u2019re already hearing about that. So frankly, this is nothing but good news. I\u2019m thrilled with the work done by Doug McNeill, by the Mayor and his staff. Everybody has been scrambling to solve a problem instead of thinking it's a conspiracy, we should be thanking people and appreciating their incredible work and their brilliant achievement to reduce our risk as a City. So I don't understand why anyone would oppose this and I\u2019m thrilled to see our Labour Council friends here and the workers who now have jobs well into the future and probably more jobs coming, which is good for the whole Province of Manitoba.

I think that would\u2019ve been a preferred route if the terms had been agreeable to both parties, and I think that's\u2026that would have been an ideal scenario. However, we\u2019re here now, I just\u2026I wanted to, I guess, convey a  heart-felt  thank you to His Worship Mayor Bowman, to Doug McNeil with, from our administration. I really do think that they\u2019ve done everything they can do to have\u2026to put together something that works for everybody. And we are keeping 50, at least 50 St. Boniface jobs in St. Boniface. I\u2026I just\u2026Jenny Gerbasi was saying that I think this is a\u2026she thought that this was a good story all around. I do think this is a good story for Winnipeg and for St. Boniface in particular and I just want to mention a few of the benefits that this move will mean for St. Boniface, just reading out of page 11 of the report. It\u2019s going to mean a removal of an industrial operation within a residential area, approximately 2.1 acres. It\u2019s going to reduce noise levels within residential neighbourhood. It's going to complement higher and better use of the existing Parmalat site. There\u2019s going to be the potential for redevelopment of the lands currently occupied by Parmalat to residential use such as  multi-family.  There\u2019s going to be reduced truck traffic within residential\u2026within a residential downtown area. There is an average of 38 trucks per day and Parmalat currently accounts for approximately 20 percent of heavy truck traffic come from Provencher Boulevard. There will be elimination of 300 tons of industrial ammonia from the current location. And so, those are just a few of the benefits in particular for St. Boniface and in terms of the benefits for Winnipeg and Manitoba, we\u2019re keeping at least 50 jobs in the Province of Manitoba. And I am just thrilled to see 50 St. Boniface jobs stay in St. Boniface and not only are they staying in St. Boniface, but they\u2019re going to be relocated to a new\u2026brand new facility and in a more appropriate site. I do realize that there is a little bit of risk here because we\u2019re getting it, involved in a development venture. But I do\u2026I do think that His Worship, Brian Bowman, Chair of the Property Committee, John Orlikow and our administration will do everything they possibly can to, to make sure that our tax dollars are being respected. And this is a great story for St. Boniface and for Winnipeg, so thank you everyone for getting everything done so quickly and for sticking your necks out for these workers for St. Boniface and for Winnipeg.

      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I appreciate the discussion today on this. And this is a success story for the City of Winnipeg and certainly the valued employees of Parmalat. In terms of due process, I do want to speak to that. The negotiations were occurring until Monday afternoon with Parmalat as well as the Province, and there were two options, one was simply to walk it on today, the other was to hold the Council seminar, which I was pleased to see many of the members of Council chose to attend, others did not. We then moved it to PP and D where it received unanimous support yesterday, Special EPC meeting this morning and then of course, today's discussion. I did, and I do appreciate the unanimous support. I\u2019m not sure what changed for the member, the Councillor from Transcona from yesterday to today, but that's certainly his prerogative and I respect his view, as well as respect his view to not suspend or not want to suspend the rules to hear this matter. Certainly, it\u2019s something within his ability as any member of Council to choose to suspend the rules or not. I do know what the Councillor from Transcona publicly called on me to save the Parmalat jobs within the last two weeks. We\u2019ve done that and we presented, I think, a pragmatic approach to dealing with problem of developing these lands that really the previous Council was unable to deliver on. So I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019re presenting a\u2026not only a pragmatic solution of the problem, but we\u2019ve been able to bring the Province to the table and I want to thank them for joining us in contributing $2 million to this project as well as Parmalat contributing $1.5 million. They really took all parties working collaboratively together to be able to present this motion to Council today and so I would urge members of Council to support it, and I would like to ask the speaker if we could have Doug McNeil address many of the questions that the have been raised here today, many of which were addressed by him yesterday at the Council seminar.

But would have liked to have a lot more time as the Mayor indicated, we did follow due process, all be it, was fast tracked and it was absolutely necessary. This is the last Council meeting until September and Parmalat wants to be in the ground, needs to be in the ground next month and it was absolutely necessary for Council to consider this report today. We literally came to a conclusion, came to a deal, the City, the Province and Parmalat late Friday afternoon. That deal was signed off Monday afternoon by Parmalat, and of course is subject to Council decision today and subject to the Provincial Cabinet decision today as well in terms of the terms of that deal. We had been working with Parmalat for several weeks now because, you know, the Terracon deal, these things don't just die overnight. There are a lot of concerns. When I started with the City back in April, I personally got involved with this file, got involved with Terracon. I have known Terracon senior officials for 30 years, have a lot of respect for them, but at the end of the day, they came to the conclusion that they couldn't sign the Joint Venture Agreement. Suspecting that that might happen, we started working with Parmalat fairly early on to determine what their needs were and wanted to see them stay and we are very happy to see that they\u2019ve come to the table along with the Province and really indicating how serious they wanted to stay in Winnipeg and in Manitoba. And wished we had more time to do this, but we worked really hard to put the report together on Monday and finalized it yesterday so that we could get to a Council seminar and follow through with the committee processes.

      "name": "Councillor Orlikow",
      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to try to help clarify for Councillor Eadie, he had some questions and I think Councillor Wyatt, even though these questions were answered at the meeting yesterday, he asked again and alluded to concerns regarding future developments the on the site. Point No. 4, in the motion is to allow the CAO to have delegated authority to work with those initially that may be interested. That doesn't require more servicing cost for us. Again, we\u2019re not sure what's out there. A lot of people say, I want to buy your house, but don't actually put the money down. So you have to make sure that the interest is actually there. Again, we\u2019re taking a lot more cautious approach. People saying that they want to do something is nice but\u2026including the Province, but until they actually sign the dotted line and we have security to know that it\u2019s actually going to happen. Again, that risk is a little high just to say handshake, hope it's okay, we'll talk about it later. So again, for the other proponents are interested in these lands, again, it is about\u2026around where we have to add servicing that we\u2019re delegate, not authority to the CAO, again it\u2019s part of the cleanup process. The other point that I want to point out in the long term plan about what we\u2019re going to do with the other\u2026I believe once we get to the retention pond out, the roadwork, the easements and blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s about 170ish acres that have to be\u2026that will be coming back into report with various options. The first joint venture didn't work, but can we figure something else out? Should we settle and outright, what are we going to do? Again, Council will have that opportunity to look at those options, go through the numbers together and we\u2019ll conclude a path forward. We\u2019re hoping sooner than later, but the administration will be\u2026is on that one right away. And another concern again, Councillor Wyatt, in his wisdom yesterday, when he\u2026when he was supporting the motion yesterday at least, we added a clause in there, No. 6 that the Winnipeg Public Service in its quarterly financial status report, with respect to this matter to Standing Committee on Finance. Again, this is below the threshold of 8.5 which is a total estimated cost. But it\u2019s at a Class 4 estimate so Councillor Wyatt raised the question, well if it\u2019s...again, taking one sight of view of this, possibly does happen and so worst, worst case scenario when everything we\u2019re saying goes off rails, the Class 4 may make it 10 million, just a bit, but we\u2026so again, we want to make sure we have those quarterly reports, so we actually added that in there to help us make sure that we keep an eye on the ball in this one. So I hope that answers most of Councillor Eadie's questions. And again, as we all know, the Parker land sale that showed up in the morning, I read in the paper. I remember that glorious one where there is a straight on  walk-on  where all of a sudden, we had to get this to Jim right away with his Parker land swap. We had no Council seminar, there was nothing. There was\u2026I read it in the Free Press in the morning when I got here. Again, so again, I know that thing feels like, and that's why when we\u2019re discussing options about how do we get this through. You can't say that, \u201cOh, I\u2019m upset about the process. I\u2019m not going to vote for it.\u201d Well, if you want to not have a process and you want us to delay this to September, fine, that\u2019s okay, vote that way, but then you also have to say, \u201cI\u2019m willing to take a large risk that Parmalat is not going to be here.\u201d You know, process is important and if that's the ultimate importance for you and that\u2019s\u2026you wish not to support this motion because of that, then just say I\u2019m okay if Parmalat is not here. I don't believe majority of Council that said that, that point. Again, we could have walked it on to Council floor, that wasn't going to be an option that was never my option. We had the seminar. We had the PPD meeting. Everyone is welcome to show up and ask questions. We had open invitation to talk to Doug. We had an EPC meeting this morning. No one showed up for that one to speak to it. Again, another opportunity to speak to it. We don\u2019t like putting things through this quickly. Absolutely not, but again, if the choice is beside, between following the rules which we did, not\u2026again, I\u2019d like to have a bit more time or losing Parmalat. I think we are making the right choice. We tried to accommodate the best we can to provide all the information we could to Councillors because we know, this Council, Council is supreme. That is the way it\u2019s working. So again, we want to get this information for you out earlier. Again, I wasn't prepared to go forward with any recommendation until we had signed documents saying, yes, we do commit to this. To say that again, we could\u2019ve gone on a handshake model, again, the handshake model is too risky. We want to have signed documents. We\u2019d done the handshake model in the past and it\u2019s cost us huge. So again, a part of my risk aversion now and part of the question we have is, is the agreement signed? Is that intent actually signed somewhere or did someone say, \u201cYeah, it's a good idea. We\u2019ll support it.\u201d But then two years later, \u201cNah, we\u2019re not going to do it anymore.\u201d Again, before we come to Council, we want to make sure that everybody has the information and it\u2019s locked down. The documents are signed. In here, so no one\u2019s saying we didn't tell you, it's Class 4. It's a Class 4 estimate. We\u2019d like it to be a bit higher. We believe it could be a little bit higher. But again, Council should know, again like some other projects where that was kind of deleted out from the reports, it's in the report, Class 4. So again, we are July 15, 2015 all a little worried about that, but we have to move forward that risk that we\u2019re taking, the 2.11 million which is coming from the City side, that risk is warranted in my opinion to make sure that Parmalat stays here and also it provides a bridge head to be able to open up this land to future development.

      "spoken": "Yes, thank you Madam Speaker. It was an honour to second your excellent motion to do this to try to address the  by-law  enforcement issues related to basically what's happening with waste being in the City of Winnipeg being dumped in our neighbourhoods and certain spots, of course, we always know things, bulk waste shows up and it's not good, Madam Speaker. So I just stepped this down though because this is an initiative to assist a  by-law  enforcement. I think that's really, really important and we need to think in context of what\u2019s really happening out there in terms of the availability for people to actually get rid of their bulk waste. For some reason, there\u2019s a number of people who think they can just dump it into neighbourhoods. There\u2019s others who just dump it down the back lane when they\u2019re leaving their premises and so on. But, you know, the people who are just, you know, driving stuff in and dumping it could be a landlord with  multi-family  and there\u2019s a whole host of things they want to get rid of and so they dump that stuff and, Madam Speaker, as you know, in your ward and in actually many wards, including the Daniel McIntyre Ward, is\u2026has got some areas that are quite bad in terms of this bulk waste dumping. So well, West Broadway, good point. It\u2019s not quite as bad anyway. But anyway, needless to say, Madam Speaker, it is a problem and  by-law  enforcement is all over the city trying to catch these people and the camera methodology would really work. I understand it's already in a process, actually, the process that I think sort of falls within ASD I think. Didn't we change the name of ASD? Somebody could correct me but I thought we call it the Innovation Committee now but, Madam Speaker, I digress. So I just wanted to say though, there is a number of things that we were hoping in the whole\u2026we passed a waste management or I can't remember the exact name of the report, but it was\u2026it was a policy and  by-law  changes to implement a better strategy to get rid of all the waste in our City of Winnipeg. And so, there was a number of strategies in there that I\u2019ll talk to later but ultimately, I think for some of these people, they\u2019re all about convenience, so it's convenient for them just to dump in our neighbourhoods, Madam Speaker. They need to have other conveniences which I will speak to in a later report, probably much later today, Madam Speaker, but thanks again, Madam Speaker for moving this motion. I was honoured to second it and hopefully we can get implemented and running as soon as possible in 2016 and start catching some people and, Madam Speaker, I really believe that when we catch these people there\u2019s some pretty still fines and so that I think would be more than enough to pay for\u2026pay for the cost of having these cameras and I\u2019m sure the system will be mobile because once you solve the problem in certain area, we hopefully, we can move it to another. And, but I also want to say, I don\u2019t know we had some consideration on a report in regard to how parking tickets will be handled under a different act. The Province passed new legislation. I\u2019m wondering if, Madam Speaker, we can utilize a better means of making sure that people who violate the waste get fined stiff penalties, not let off easy because, Madam Speaker, it's very important that they take a stiff penalty to understand that you just don't dump in our neighbourhoods. Thank you. ",

As Councillor Eadie was referring to, this Council has adopted the waste minimization strategy and as part of that, we\u2019re introducing the four urban depots in all the quadrants and we have some exciting news coming up this fall but the first coming on stream and more coming up later. This will certainly provide an opportunity to get rid of those, you know, small time construction type items, excess  oil-base  paints and small home project stuff that is difficult to dispose of today. That\u2019ll make that part of it easier. When it comes to the bulky items, we already subsidies the pick up those items, five bucks an item. It\u2019s really not all that onerous in my mind for large household, bulky items. And again, yeah, the\u2026we should have the four guardant stations coming up in the upcoming years. I think it\u2019s supposed to be one per year. And I think that\u2019s very exciting. That\u2019s of course under the solid waste division of water and waste so good stuff. ",

It\u2019s a fairly straight forward matter in\u2026with some odd history. My predecessor, Councillor Steeves did some good work to get a 1939 Fargo fire truck taken out of storage and turned it over to the St. Vital Historical Society. It has been housed in the old Fire Hall which is also houses the St. Vital Museum. Had a wonderful 100th anniversary celebration last year and we\u2019re putting 600,000 renovations in conjunction with the Province into that building, not much history in St. Vital, some people say, but that building is a great historical landmark in St. Vital, but because of that 600,000 dollar renovation project, the fire truck had to be moved, it has now been moved a couple of times, has been discovered that people are driving it because after ten years of restoration, it's drivable. There\u2019s no insurance on it in short, Madam Speaker. The last insurance dates to 1974. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s  pre-Unicity  or not, but I think it would be  post-Unicity  if it was 1974 during the year. In any event, we need to transfer the vehicle to the folks who have done the restoration, who have possession of it. Otherwise, says Mr. Fuith indicated to me, you don't have to be a risk analysis expert to realize it's not good to have an uninsured fire truck dating from 1939 driving around on the the streets of St. Vital. So let's transfer it. Let\u2019s get it over to the people who love and maintain this thing and get it back on the street and that\u2019s the marquis attractions when we reopen the museum.

      "motion_text": "WHEREAS the Winnipeg Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies suggests that a change to the Snow Clearing Policy be considered and discussed, which could require citizens to clear their own sidewalks; AND WHEREAS the citizens of Winnipeg have expressed their concerns on the possibility of having to shovel the public sidewalks adjacent to their properties; AND WHEREAS the current snow clearing policy provides a service which maintains the condition of our sidewalks in a safe and efficient method which is the foundation of Winnipeg\u2019s year round active transportation system; AND WHEREAS requiring citizens to clear the public sidewalks around their homes would be considered a cut in service; AND WHEREAS there are many citizens who are seniors or have an accessibility issue who would have difficulty clearing the extra snow caused by this potential policy change and it could be a hardship and extra expense; THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the following text not be adopted in the Winnipeg Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies in the Section titled \u201cStrategic Direction 4 - Improve Maintenance\u201d in the  sub-heading  \u201cKey Direction 4A: Maintain the Sidewalk Network\u201d (Pages 236 to 238), and be removed, namely: Requiring residents to clear the residential sidewalks abutting their homes may be something the City considers in the future if it could result in an increase in service level. There are many factors affected by this possible change in policy that have not been investigated at this time. Currently all City sidewalks are cleared to a compacted snow surface, except sidewalks in the Downtown which are generally plowed to a paved surface whenever conditions allow. Residential sidewalks are normally cleared within 5 working days. Work on weekends and holidays are limited. This means that the snow on these sidewalks has been left for several days to a week. By this time the snow accumulation has been packed and hardened, by cold weather, wind, and pedestrian activity, in such a way that removal requires heavy equipment. If the snow was cleared within 24 hours this would not be a significant issue. As a result it would be possible that the snow clearing could be done by hand by the residents. It is possible that funding savings resulting from residents being responsible for clearing residential sidewalks could be used to increase the quality of snow clearing efforts on higher priority sidewalks. For example all sidewalks might be cleared to a paved surface instead of a compacted snow surface. In addition, it could be possible to snow clear some of the designated park pathways that currently are only cleared as a last priority and only when adequate funds are available. However, the administration and enforcement of a policy requiring residents to clear residential sidewalks would have a cost associated with it. This issue requires further study in order to determine its feasibility. There are significant problems related to the idea of residents being responsible for clearing sidewalks abutting their residents. Many residents are physically unable to clear sidewalks or are away from their homes during snow events. In addition, it is reasonable to expected significant opposition to such a radical change in snow clearing policy. If the idea proves to be financially feasible a comprehensive public consultation program would be required in order to determine whether this policy change could be instituted. Develop support programs to encourage resident sidewalk snow removal on residential streets. As noted above, the \u201cSpecial Sidewalks\u201d category would be the responsibility of the owner or occupant of any building abutting a public sidewalk. Although it is common in most cities across North America to require owners and occupants to clear sidewalks on residential streets, this is a significant change for Winnipeg. As such, the City should develop support programs to encourage resident sidewalk snow removal on residential streets. This could include: \u2022 Establishing a snow angels program to support sidewalk clearing for seniors and others with mobility restrictions during the winter. Snow Angels programs are typically reliant on neighbours and volunteers to help neighbours to clear public sidewalks after a snowfall, so seniors and\/or those with mobility issues, can still use the sidewalks to run errands, go shopping, and travel around. Snow Angels programs recognize the importance of walking for vulnerable groups, and would be a way to facilitate a safe walking environment  year-round  in Winnipeg. \u2022 Establishing a reporting program for those who are unable to clear their sidewalk, especially for those unable to clear their sidewalk due to health or mobility impairments, or who are on vacation and unable to clear their sidewalks, the City should establish a reporting program on the City\u2019s website for residents to notify the City and request support.\u201d Motion No. 6 Moved by Councillor Wyatt, Seconded by Councillor Schreyer, WHEREAS the Transcona Trail, over 6 kilometres in length, is the backbone of the existing Active Transportation network in the Transcona Ward; AND WHEREAS the neighbourhood has taken great ownership over the Transcona Trail and is actively used on a daily basis, especially in the spring, summer and fall; AND WHEREAS the Transcona Trail currently ends at Regent Avenue, with the major 6 lane arterial of Regent Avenue being a barrier for its planned continuation along the CEMR\/CNR Rail corridor thru to Panet Road, and ultimately onto Archibald Street; AND WHEREAS the said future section of the Transcona Trail, namely from Regent Avenue West to Panet Road, will be the main commuter network and connection to Downtown Winnipeg for cyclists; AND WHEREAS this is the planned alignment of the Eastern Rapid Transit Corridor and therefore consistent with past City practice of combining Rapid Transit with improvements in our Active Transportation Network; AND WHEREAS the existing gap in the Transcona Trial, from Regent Avenue West to Panet Road, requires cyclists to take their lives in their own hands, commuting in heavy traffic on Regent Avenue West, from the Transcona Trail to Panet Road; AND WHEREAS the Transcona Trail extension, from Regent Avenue West to Panet Road is presently being considered by the public service, has an estimated cost of approximately $700,000.00 and is listed in Appendix A as a Moderate\/High Priority Bicycle Facility Construction\/Improvement Priority (Appendix A, P.311, Bicycle Network Priorities); AND WHEREAS the Appendix A of the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategy calls for a New Crossing to be built over Lagimodiere Boulevard, between Ravelston Avenue West and Callsbeck Ave, which are both gravel roads, and both listed as low priorities themselves in the same document; AND WHEREAS the Appendix A completely ignores the need for a new crossing over Regent Avenue at the Transcona Trail, even though the cover 6 km of the Trail is already established from Regent Avenue eastward, and, as stated, the next section of the Transcona Trail, from Regent Avenue West to Panet Road, is considered a moderate\/high priority by the Same Appendix A document; THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the June 23, 2015 recommendation of the Standing Policy Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works Pedestrian and Cycling Strategy report (Item 4), namely the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategy (Appendix A), and the amendments to the Transportation Master Plan (Appendix B), be amended to reflect the following: July 15, 2015 i) Deleting the requirement for a New Crossing at Callsbeck Avenue\/Ravelston Avenue\/Lagimodiere Blvd; ii) A New Crossing at the western terminus of the existing Transcona Trail over the barrier of Regent Avenue West.

Namely, first of all, the matter of consultation and the matter of cost. Regarding consultation pages, roman numeral 12 and 108 in the document call for more localized public consultation to be done as part of any attempt to implement elements of the strategy, however, my concern was\u2026remains that there was a need for Council to spell out that area stakeholders including residents, business owners and the local Councillor be engaged in consultation before any new pedestrian or cycling infrastructure is built in their community. But, according to the disposition records on June 23, 2015 and the Standing Policy Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works task the office of public engagement to report back with the public engagement policy for pedestrian and cycling annual action plan. This policy is to incorporate best practices for public engagement as identified by the international association for public participation and I am confident that this public engagement policy will with the input of Councillors and once finalized satisfy my concerns with regard to the need for local\u2026thorough localized consultation which brings me to my second concern in regards to the cost. Prior to today's Council meeting, I heard from 19 residents, 19, pardon me, households, 19 households in the St.  James\u2013Brooklands-Weston  Ward on the Pedestrian Cycling Strategy. Thirteen of those who contacted me asked me to support the document. Six requested that I oppose it. Those who voiced disapproval are opposed because of the potential $334 million price tag attached to the full implementation of strategies. Many of them point out the fact that our city needs that money to repair, renew our local streets. I agree with them, however, I also recognize the city needs document to set direction for future active transportation infrastructure and therefore as per\u2026nine, page 19 of the document, I view the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies as a supplement to the City\u2019s other master planning documents, specifically Our Winnipeg and the transportation master plan. And yes, committed to the full $334 million still concerns me, which is why I am bringing forward Motion No. 1 that states all costs included in the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies are estimates. No budget allocation is included with the approval of the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies document and all projects and project costs related to the pedestrian and cycling July 15, 2015 strategies document will be considered by Council through the annual budget process. This motion, Madam Speaker, endeavours to remove ambiguity as to the immediate budgeting implications attached to this document. Council can choose to implement as much or as little of the strategy as it, we, deem appropriate by making corresponding budgetary decisions on year by year basis and so I ask the Mayor and my Council colleagues to support this motion.

And this motion specifically speaks to the issue of the snow clearing policy. There was a lot of confusion and misinformation created by some of the advertising and different things that were said and this motion is really, and one of the whereases, it says on page 237 of the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies, it says a comprehensive public consultation program would be required in order to determine whether this policy change could be instituted. And the motion is really and it\u2019s the wording is here such that Council requires assurance that the understood intent is followed. So it\u2019s really just reinforcing what is in the document already that we\u2019re not going to wake up one morning and the policy will be changed without even knowing about it. There is a comprehensive public consultation process and policy discussion that would have to take place with this idea to even be considered. So the resolves\u2026the resolve is simply that the report be accepted with the following condition, that a comprehensive public consultation program be mandatory in the future to amend current residential sidewalks, snow clearing practices as noted in the document. So nothing could happen without a comprehensive public consultation process and that's really all the motion is saying, it\u2019s really just to reassure people because they were told in radio ads that this was just going to happen, that there wasn\u2019t going to be any proper process and I just think we need to make that clear for the public. I think they should have the proper information. And you know, the reason it came up in the document was that we actually have a problem with\u2026our snow is not cleared very quickly and it\u2019s a\u2026how do people walk down the sidewalk and get where they are going. We don\u2019t come to three or four days later to clear it. So there was a discussion that I would expect came from the community and people that wanted to have better lives as pedestrians that wanted to look at different options and this is only an option that was looked at. There are other cities that actually do that and their sidewalks have to be cleared within 24 hours. Now, if I can find a way to, you know, snap our fingers and have our sidewalks cleared within 24 hours, it would be wonderful I think for our pedestrians. I can say, in the Osborne Village, they suffer. They don't have cars, a lot of them and they suffer when those sidewalks are not cleared. So it\u2019s a legitimate policy issue to discuss and look at what we can do in Winnipeg, but we\u2019re not doing it. We\u2019re having the discussion and it's obviously politically something that might not happen because it\u2019s very difficult to have that discussion here and it may not happen at all and the report does not dictate it in any way that it\u2019s going to happen. So the motion is just to clarify that, that there will be lots and lots of process before anything could ever change and nothing will be sprung on anybody. Thank you, Madam Speaker. ",

      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I\u2019m feeling quite disillusioned right now in terms of the process. This is a 20 year process but we are giving birth to it right now. It's been in gestation for a couple of years. I guess one can say in terms of a consultation process, which I will not criticize other than to say it's merely incomplete. It\u2019s part of some that we all agree it is to continue. But after two years of consultation, it arrived at something that I don't believe that Council believes that all these amendments are not worthy of consideration. I don't believe that for a moment. People took good time and effort and care based on their knowledge, based on consultations, based on trying to do their best in terms of trying to make this document as good as possible and trying to have the best debate we could at this point, today, before it went out to its greater path of consultation. But there are great uncertainties, concerns, possibilities to make this a better document in which more people could have confidence and more confidence in the process. These are the things that I, as well as other Councillors, wanted to consider today. Wanted discussed today and have an open debate today. In terms of the process that brought us here, they saved $400,000 in two years, okay. But I know as an example, Mark Cohoe of Bike Winnipeg did after my two hours of discussion with him, it could have gone longer but we went for two hours that after two\u2026$400,000 in two years and communication outreach of, as they say, hundreds of phone calls of information and surveys, my contribution to that budget of my $700 of taxpayers\u2019 money that I allocated was the first time in that process that there is any communication outreach on the budget, of this and the fact that 95 percent of active transportation system, that being our sidewalks, was offered for consideration in terms of the City being\u2026the City abdicating its responsibility, getting rid of its responsibility for the safe and efficient maintenance of 95 percent of our active transportation system. But that wasn't part of the communication process up until this time, up until last week. And that was part of my contribution as we came to this point, to deliberate in our process and the political process before it went from here. And there\u2019s concerns all over the place. These 20 odd amendments are just\u2026just an aspect of that, but we know there is going to be more, but we know that they address some fundamental aspects. And it would have been great\u2026it would have been great to have that discussion on the record so that everybody had greater understanding in terms of Council's understanding of this document before it was passed and an understanding of process that was going to take place before this was passed. I don't know what else to say other than to say, this could have been a different document. I could have gone back to my constituents and said, \"This is the document with the process of which I have confidence enough in to support\" because I really want to. And maybe it's just because I am a new Councillor. Maybe it's because I am a new Councillor, because I have concerns over interpretation that have not been resolved nor cannot be resolved merely by saying, \u201cjust go ahead and vote for it\u201d, what I am told by a few people, \u201cwell, just ignore that part and vote for it\u201d, I am told. \u201cjust close your eyes over those pages and vote for it.\u201d Instead, where there is some form of agreement on consensus that I felt that would make this a better document as we went forward, well, it's not going to happen. We don't have that opportunity today. And it's truly unfortunate. There are so many good ideas that were brought forth today so that everyone could have confidence in this or at least we could have consensus that democracy and process in this chamber took place that we could say we had that\u2026we had that discussion on record in front of people. I\u2019ve had discussions with people over the last, well, months, weeks. I have really gotten to know this document and I am confident in terms of my contribution up until\u2026to this point, up until this point that my contribution is as worthy as any other Councillor. My understanding of this document I dare say is at least as good as well, no. I suspect there\u2019s a few Councillors that understand this document more than I do, that read more than I did. I think there\u2019s a few, I would hazard to guess. And I was looking forward to an exciting process of which I could say, well I voted for, which would have been sort of a symbolic support. I do look forward to continuing to be part of this process as we put forth, we enhance, we continue to enhance our active transportation systems in the city. I just think it\u2019s going to be harder work, but I\u2019m glad for my contribution to this point. And everything I\u2019ve said and everything I\u2019ve done so far, I believe is a projection of what will be taking place in the process as we move forward. And I believe that. I say again for the record, everything I\u2019ve said and everything I\u2019ve done regarding this document is a projection of that which will be taking place and on that basis\u2026 ",

I truly do wish as an aspect in terms of principles I think of this, the intention I think we all have is that in the first five years of this\u2026this plan we won't have the opportunity\u2026well, we won't have the opportunity, well, we won\u2019t have the opportunity today and July 15, 2015 how we\u2019ll all create that central mechanism which we can make central decisions if we...greater equitable distribution of routes in their first five years because in the first five years, it says in the plan, there\u2019ll be none in southeast Winnipeg, two kilometres or so in southeast Winnipeg, 5.8 kilometres in northeast Winnipeg, about 24 kilometres in what they call the north section but all primarily downtown and in terms of building those connectivity in the first five years in this term, at this point, it\u2019s not going to happen. My concern is thus as this goes forward in called policy, we will be creating make- work projects as we have other agencies involved, involving us, in trying to make this a better document even though we could\u2019ve done that today.

It's perfectly clear.\u201d We\u2019re confusing the problem and the issue. The problem is the report isn't perfect, the issue is. Doing something more on our bike and pedestrian strategy. Is the document perfect? No, of course, it isn\u2019t. Is the\u2026was the consultation perfect? Absolutely, not. I\u2026you know, we have had a lot of people, a lot of rhetoric here both sides. Some of it\u2019s been, \u201cWell, Councillors didn\u2019t go to the open houses, therefore, they can\u2019t criticize\u201d. I went to one of the open houses. I raised the point. Why is there a bridge leading through the Canoe Club Golf Course. I was told, \u201cWell, we tried to space them evenly.\u201d And it\u2019s in the report. I mean so I don't think going to the sessions would\u2019ve solved all the problems here. So what do we do with this? Do we reject the whole thing? Do we try to amend it so that there\u2019s half a bridge because one Councillor wants a bridge at one particular location and the other one doesn\u2019t? No, we try to pass this thing and then work it through as a living, breathing document. I think it\u2019s important to take a look at what Mark Cohoe said earlier which was \u201cguide but not dictate\u201d. And that\u2019s I think what we\u2019re looking at here. It\u2019s a guideline. Now, how do we know that? How do we know it doesn't bind our hands? How do we know it doesn\u2019t dictate? Well, here is one example. Because frankly, I intend in the future to raise the issue of what I see is the shortcoming here which is a\u2026doesn\u2019t talk about the Seine River and as a warning I will lapse into French here at some point to the regret of all, Madam Speaker, so get our translation staff to work up there. But I think you could say, well, how do we know, how\u2026why aren\u2019t we strictly bound by this? Well, the answer is on page 181, 182, It calls for a bridge from the Forks to Universit\u00e9 de  Saint-Boniface.  The problem with that is there is already a bridge for pedestrians to bike from the Forks to University of St. Boniface. So if you take this document literally, you would be tearing down a bridge to put in a new bridge. Obviously, that\u2019s not the intent if you check with the staff. They say that\u2019s a database problem. We should\u2019ve said that was existing infrastructure. So I mean, people say to me, \u201cNo, no, no, it's absolutely binding. It absolutely dictates.\u201d They\u2019re wrong. Obviously, we\u2019re going to have to apply it with some flexibility. It\u2019s meant be a guide. It\u2019s not meant to dictate. The other couple of things I want to point out here are it\u2019s an important opportunity. It\u2019s an important opportunity to look at our riverbanks again and the\u2026one of\u2026the committee I chair in part is called riverbank management. I think we have to take a look at what this could mean for our riverbanks, the Seine, the Red, the Assiniboine in particular. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity here to do something. The Mayor in his election platform said, \u201cThe rivers that run through our city are our greatest asset. We should develop this infrastructure to have more river paths and I agree with that and I think that\u2019s an opportunity that this presents to look at the two together. We have riverbank stabilization issues at places like Lyndale Drive in Councillor Allard\u2019s ward, the Glasgow area in Councillor Gerbasi\u2019s ward, River to River Gate, Councillor Luke\u2019s ward. And frankly, while I don\u2019t agree with that we may need a bridge from the Canoe Club. That is, for me, this is an opening on a debate I\u2019ve been wanting for years here which is\u2026that is the single biggest riverbank stabilization need we have identified in our budget year after year is the Canoe Club. So I want to use this as a springboard to start that discussion to say, \u201cLook, what can we do? Can we combine this strategy with some of our other Civic needs and I intend to follow up on that as the Chair of the Riverbank Committee. So that\u2026the third thing I want to mention is just a local issue I guess or an issue that I intend to work closely with Councillor Allard, that is the issue of the Seine River, second longest river within the City of Winnipeg boundaries. It's not mentioned in here and some might say, \u201cWell, they are the experts. They are the experts. They didn't mention it\u201d. Well, you\u2019ve got a report here from the year 2000 by\u2026by some experts that calls for five bridges over the Seine River, \u2026different experts. Actually, it's interesting that some of the Seine experts like our current CAO was on this report in 2000. So I think this is part of the debate, part of the tension that\u2019s going to go forward is what to do with these different aspects of the City. So\u2026 Translation of French spoken: ",

I think there remains a need for another bridge for pedestrians, for bicycles, on the Seine River, especially given that a bridge over the Red River costs 20 million dollars, while a bridge over the Seine River costs only 1 million dollars.

Let\u2019s keep building on the strategy whether it's bridges or whether it\u2019s pathways.

As an area Councillor, I feel I haven't had the influence that I need to on a very important long term plan that not affects\u2026not only affects the entire city but also the ward and the residents I represent in North Kildonan. I\u2019ve never felt I lost as much control over City process where I can't look in the eyes of my constituents and say, \u201cYou know what, there is a proposed neighbourhood greenway going down in your street.\u201d That could slow traffic right down. We\u2019ll spend piles of money that you don\u2019t want to spend on thing like mini roundabouts potentially, curb bump outs, speed humps, reduce speed limits potentially. It's insane. It\u2019s nuts. These streets in some cases don't even have a sidewalk on a single side of the street when they are local collector streets. How does that make any sense whatsoever? We\u2019ve got a whole raft of considerate, well thought out proposals to fix and make this document better. Not interested. We\u2019re going to write them off. They\u2019ve got bridges where they make no sense in St. Vital we\u2019re hearing today. Why aren\u2019t we going to consider that even when Council did bring it up over a year ago. No, not interested. Thoroughly disappointing. I think everybody around this Council floor wants to get more involved in active transportation. They want to be able to, you know, go for a walk to get some ice cream to go to a lounge to have a beverage to, you know, enjoy their communities, to go and meet with their people, to get out of the house, to get off the couch. We want to do these things. We want to build a city like that, but...we\u2019re not listening to the people at the ground level. $334 million dollars over 20 years. Is that the right number? Is that too little, is it too much? Why are we putting such a big number out there for such a long term without properly considering these things? We\u2019ve got a major financial problem here. The City's credit was downgraded yesterday. We\u2019ve got hundreds of millions of dollars that are being spent on Phase 2 of rapid transit. We\u2019ve got promises and expectations out there. Why are we setting people\u2019s expectations is something I don\u2019t think we can deliver on. We\u2019ve got to have a plan we can have these things, but to say that it\u2019s going to be done 20 years and this is, you know, the type of thing we\u2019re looking at? Irresponsible. Shame. It's too much. Suggesting\u2026we went through a process towards the end of last Council to be sure where we had an independent group come in and do an audit on our Public Works Department. It pointed out that in other jurisdictions; snow clearing is sometimes the responsibility of the adjoining home owner. Did it suggest like it did for many other things, perhaps this is something that, you know, we could change in the City of Winnipeg? No. It suggests status quo is okay. Council adopted that. How many of you were out, out on the campaign trail saying, \u201cYou know what, we\u2019d like to pitch in. We\u2019d like to shovel our sidewalks.\u201d How many seniors do you have in your area that are already struggling to keep in their homes? They want to age in place. When you talk about Complete Communities and our community strategy, being able to continue living in your existing area is a key principle of it. This is contrary to that if we\u2019re going to consider it. If we really were serious about it, I see there is an amended motion, but it really does nothing. If we are serious about not having residents consider, for not considering it, take it out now. Don\u2019t leave it for another day. Right now, we are still  wishy-washy  on it. It\u2019s the one on table. Why are we doing that? It's crazy. I mean we were all elected last fall. All of us were sworn in except Councillor Morantz on November 4. \u201cI, Jeff Browaty do solemnly promise and declare that I will truly, faithfully and impartially to the best of my knowledge and ability execute the office to which I have been elected\u201d. You  r eally believe that you are representing all your constituents, maybe Councillor Gerbasi, maybe your ward is a little different. Do you really believe that this is not a biased document in many respects that the residents on these streets have not been properly consulted? It doesn't matter if you\u2019re trying to bias to a friend, a family member or a developer or a special interest group in this case. I don't think this represents the vast majority of even cyclists that use bikes in the neighbourhoods today. I still\u2026I used the word earlier, \u2018hijack\u2019; I still believe today that a bike lobby has hijacked this process. There\u2019s still an opportunity to do something that\u2019s going to be great for our community, that\u2019s going to get more people out of\u2026off their couches and on to streets without going to this extreme. I will not be supporting the amendments or this motion today. I think this could have been a really great, progressive thing for our city.

      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. As you know, I\u2019ve consistently supported having a comprehensive plan and a meaningful investment in biking and walking strategies. The transportation master plan of Our Winnipeg, our city plan called for more detailed strategy for walking and cycling infrastructure and that is what is before us today. And I July 15, 2015 continue to support this because I believe that the walking and cycling strategy is extremely important for the future of our City, our quality of life, our environmental and fiscal sustainability. Its time has come and I would really hate to see our City lag further behind and fail to reach its potential. The ad campaign and other actions of opponents to this plan are obviously more of a political maneuver than about informing the public. And I would point out that you can't have it both ways, as some former Councillors often used to say in debates, \u201cYou can't suck and blow at the same time.\u201d If you\u2019re trying to stop a plan from proceeding, you\u2019re cutting the budget down by to one fifth of the original budget. You\u2019re saying we should spend on roads and not spend on active transportation and cycling. You\u2019re whipping up public fear unnecessarily. I\u2019m sorry, you can't keep saying you\u2019re supportive of active transportation. Let\u2019s be honest. You can't have it both ways. Improvement to our ability to walk and bike in Winnipeg is something our citizens want. The report shows that large numbers of people would make the choice to bike more or walk more if they felt safer and comfortable doing so. This brings so many benefits, reducing wear and tear on the roads, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and congestion, not to mention happier and healthier citizens. I think it's sad that this campaign and other efforts have created unnecessary fears and negativity about something that is so positive, hopeful and much needed as a step in our city's development. I\u2019m confident that the majority of Council will not be sidetracked. The report in front of us says very clearly, it should be recognized that the pedestrian cycling strategy is a long term, strategic planning document as such is not intended to address site specific or corridor specific issues. Rather it is intended to represent a package of actions that were implemented over time will help the City achieve its strategic vision. With the extensive consultation required before projects proceed as outlined in the report. Citizens will have a voice in these transportation projects more so than they do now with rode and other City projects. But the ad campaign is only the latest in a series of attempts to put up roadblocks, not necessarily by everybody in this room or anybody in this room, but only the latest in a series of attempts to put up roadblocks to the strategic plan. The first attempt to completely destroy this project was in July of 2013 when Councillor Wyatt happened to be an EPC member and Chair of Finance. Behind closed doors, a secret political decision was made to cancel the contract for the entire AT strategies project. Even though the consultant had already been hired and the work had already begun. Without any Council vote, public announcement or consultation with Councillors, it was stopped in its tracks, not exactly a model of openness. When we discovered it inavertedly that this had happened, there was a huge outcry from the community, the media and some on Council which led to the project being restarted again although the budget was actually cut. The previous Mayor and EPC including the former Finance Chair then kept the project under wraps and at a standstill throughout 2014. Thankfully, under Mayor Bowman's leadership, the report was finally tabled and not long after that process, more things started to happen. Around the time the strategy was tabled, I learned that my downtown ward was targeted with over a hundred letters that were sent to downtown businesses that I represent about the bike lanes. A meeting was called by the Councillor from Transcona to get businesses riled up by fear mongering and providing misleading information about the strategy. Business owners were told exaggerated claims that parking would be stripped away and they wouldn't be consulted. Wisely, the Mayor asked for a report clarifying the consultation process and succeeded in calming down the fears that had been whipped up and the consultation report is in front of us today and it says that significant consultation was done that was adequate and meets current standards. Going forward, there will be comprehensive consultation before projects are built. But that wasn't actually the end of it. And the last time I checked, Fort  Rouge-East  Fort Garry residents elected one Councillor and they elected one Mayor. They don't get to vote in Transcona. But that didn't stop the East  Kildonan-Transcona  Community Committee from moving a motion cutting out 50 percent of the downtown bike lanes in my ward. It's unfortunate that other elected Councillors were not informed or consulted when they made that decision to take projects out of my ward. That\u2019s not the rule of other local Councillors. You know, the world has changed a lot since the 1950s. People want and need these choices. Not everyone can afford a car and many people prefer to have safe accessible alternatives such was walking and biking and taking transit and until recent years almost all infrastructure resources went solely to car oriented projects and these projects often neglected to consider the needs of pedestrians and cyclists. There\u2019s been an imbalance and how we have invested and this strategy is a pretty good start in writing that wrong and putting it in perspective, one road project, for example, the Marion Street widening alone is over $300 million for one project in one place. In contrast, this\u2026in contrast, this strategy covers every part of the city of Winnipeg and provides benefit to every single citizen whatever choice they make about transportation. Supporting active transportation is also good for business. You only need to go by the thriving Sherbrook Street area to see the positive impact of the successful parking protected bike project there. Studies show the benefits to business as people walking and biking carry their wallets with them. But people need to feel safe and more comfortable before they\u2019ll make choices to bike or walk or take the bus rather than drive, and that means protected bike lanes and safer intersections among other things. I have permission to share a letter from Josie Loeppky who wrote this to the Councillors who are opposing the strategy. \u201cCity Councillors, what is my brain actually worth to you? Five weeks ago, a car hit me as I rode my bike in an unprotected bike lane on Garry Street. I was left with a serious concussion, a large cut on my nose and various bruises. The doctors and nurses told me I was lucky, they\u2019d seen much worse vehicle and cyclist accidents. I consider myself lucky too. However, since this accident, my quality of life has drastically changed. I can\u2019t play sports, focus and remember things. I get pounding headaches that start midway through the day and continue into the evening. Yet one of the worst outcomes from this accident is that I am unable to ride my bike. For the past five years, I commuted to and from the university and my job on my bicycle during the summer month. At 26 years old, I never owned a vehicle up until a few weeks ago. When I bike I always use caution, never trusting drivers to understand unprotected bike lanes. I feel drivers and cyclists have always struggled to share the road in Winnipeg and at the scene of my accident, a number of cyclists stopped to help me. One cyclist revealed that a car already hit her this year. I was taken aback by her frankness and the conscious resignation she and I now understand that as cyclists, our commute is the risk we take, a risk that can cost us our lives. Councillors, I know I\u2019m a stranger to you, but what if I was a cyclist you knew and cared about deeply? Would you still argue against the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategy? Would my brain still not be worth more than point four percent of the capital budget to you? I want you to understand that the five minutes I spend riding in the protected lane\u2026extension, please. On Assiniboine Avenue\u2026 ",

I know I\u2019m just one person, but during the month of May and June, they\u2019re estimated 13,789 daily cyclists commuting to and from the downtown area, collectively our limbs, brains and lives are worth 330 million over the next 20 years. I sincerely hope most of us will be around to see this plan come to fruition because I recently learned it\u2019s very really possible that some of us won't be. Please reconsider your stance on the Pedestrian and Cyclist Strategy and on your commute home tonight, please watch out for cyclists\u201d. And I mention this because safety is a big issue. I\u2019m excited to think of our future, of Winnipeg moving ahead with this strategy which considers all aspects including connectivity, convenience, safety, accessibility and maintenance of infrastructure, improving vibrancy and increasing awareness. And looking back on this debate, I think those who were against going forward with this long term plan for walking and biking improvements will find themselves to have been on the wrong side of history. In conclusion, I\u2019m optimistic that the majority of this Council will recognize and value the years of consultation and comprehensive policy development that has been done to get us to this point and together with solid leadership, commitment and honest dialogue, I believe we can continue to build a more modern, vibrant, happier and safer city and I think I\u2019ll just leave it there.

      "spoken": "Madam Speaker, through you I want to thank all members of this Council for sharing their voices on this important discussion today. Because the Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies are the long term vision, guideline, it is very important for future health as Councillor Gerbasi just pointed out, safety and improved opportunities and quality of life for Winnipeggers. The 2011 transportation master plan, another of the City's long term infrastructure vision documents has the same intent and goals to establish directions on policy, infrastructure and programming for implementing long term vision for active transportation in Winnipeg. In fact, Madam Speaker, as you know, the strategies come as a result of two recommendations from the transportation master plan, one from Section 5.2.1 to develop a city wide pedestrian strategy to support pedestrian activity and connectivity and that will maintain the walking network to address year round pedestrian needs, and two from section 5.2.2 of the TMP to develop a city wide cycling strategy that provides integrated guidance for the City\u2019s efforts to support cycling activity and connectivity and to address an all season maintenance strategy for the core cycling network. Note the language, Madam Speaker, to support pedestrian activity that provides integrated guidance for the City's efforts to support cycling activity. Like the transportation master plan, it was never intended to address site specific issues. Rather, its intent is to present a package of actions that when implemented over time will help the City achieve its active transportation vision. These strategies bring together both in one 20 year overview and just like the good Councillor from Transcona warned, members of Council should not  pre-judge  ideas before they head for Council decision. That was Councillor Wyatt, Madam Speaker, in October of 2013 when a third party report recommended to Council to reduce winter maintenance standards after significant snowfalls. He warned not to  pre-judge  and it note\u2026also noted it would be premature to start cherry picking what we like and don't like from the report. I\u2019m not certain what has changed for the Councillor, Madam Speaker, though he is certainly allowed as we have seen him do today on the Parmalat decision as every member of this Council is entitled to do so to change his mind on any matter which is the beauty of a strategy document, Madam Speaker. We have a guiding document to help make decisions but we are bound by none and no shovel will hit the ground on any one project until decisions are made by this Council in this Chamber. Even if the Council of the day has changed its opinion on some of the recommendations within this guiding document. Our colleague from Mynarski just had a change of mind as well, Madam Speaker. In May of 2013, Councillor Eadie is on public record accusing one of his current advertising partners on pedestrian and cycling misinformation, Councillor Wyat,t of mounting a political campaign with the intension of influencing Council votes during a plan to sell off City owned golf courses before Council vote had been completed. Again, I don\u2019t know what has changed for the Councillor who now seems to believe along with others, it is in the best interest of his residents in Mynarski to purchase ads to influence this vote here today, Madam Speaker. And again, it doesn\u2019t really matter why his opinion has changed, but it does give me hope, Madam Speaker. Hope that the good Councillors can change his mind back to support both the will and the right of Council to choose along with the right of Winnipeggers to have their Council explore health and safe pedestrian and cycling options established on a framework, Madam Speaker, would you like me to stop?

The Councillor's ads say it's time to look after our streets. Well, Madam Speaker, everyone around this chamber with the exception of Councillor Schreyer and Dobson voted to invest record levels into repairing Winnipeg streets, sidewalks and lanes, $103.3 million in the 2015 budget that we passed  14-2  in March in this chamber. It's ironic that these two Councillors who are running these very misleading ads that this must either be an either or decision between street renewal or active transportation. Yet, they voted against street investment. It appears they too have since changed their minds. And I hope that they have changed their opinions for good on street renewal, Madam Speaker. I made it my number one commitment during the election last fall and I am deeply proud of the construction that we\u2019re all seeing going on. Triple the construction because it\u2019s triple the investment from 2012, unprecedented renewal is going on into our city's road infrastructure this year. Through this strategy, one of the recommendations is for sight in planning to include AT projects at the same time that renewal projects occur while streets are being torn up already, a strategic recommendation amongst many. Like all the recommendations contained within this report, Madam Speaker, they are all things \"worth taking a look at.\" I want to thank Councillors Gerbasi and Gillingham and Lukes for their motions today to provide not only clarity to the intent to the recommendations in this strategies document, but for their support for the integrity of their language and recommendations contained in the report. As elected members, we might sometimes forget that we\u2019re elected to make decisions and speak on behalf of our citizens and not instead of them. No project that the City has undergone a consultation process as extensive as that undertaken through the development of this pedestrian and cycling strategies document, to modify the language and the recommendations rather than reaffirm their intent would be to send a sign that we don't care about the participation of thousands and thousands and thousands of Winnipeggers. So I want to thank everyone who did participate in our community and everyone who will continue to participate as we continue to move forward and have these important discussions for 20 more years, every year through the actions plans and of course through the budget consultations. And I\u2019d also like to thank every member of this Chamber regardless of your views on this particular issue for your passion on this important matter and I ask and remind Councillors Browaty, Wyatt, Schreyer, Eadie and Dobson, those that are in the chamber right now, that there is still time for them to change their minds and vote for the future of active transportation here in Winnipeg.

Coming on to Council, I think I\u2019ve had several things before me that I think we\u2019ve had less conversation about. I feel very strongly about the strategy. I really feel that it's just an overriding document and that as a city Councillor, I will be able to give lots of input moving forward with this document. I also want to talk about the importance of equity in this piece. We forget that. We forget that we have many citizens that do not have vehicles. We forget that many citizens cannot drive vehicles. We also forget the 18.2 percent are under the age of 16 and they can only walk and they can only ride their bikes so they are limited to what they have, the choices that are available to them. I know that on my UN Safety Committee that we are on there talking about places in Mexico City that is developing this kind of strategy to make sure that women feel more safe. The more people that get out in the community, the better, for the first time, they have women in their 60s learning how to ride bikes because it's a way for them to get around the city that\u2019s safe. So I think in terms of equity. We\u2019re missing that piece. We haven't been doing a good job on that. And this will allow us to make sure that when we are developing new roads and sidewalks and new communities that we are making this a priority. And so, therefore, this is something I feel very, very strongly about. I urge the other members. I know that there\u2019s concerns, but I do really think that we\u2019re going to have time to have those discussions. I think it\u2019s just a guiding documents and not everything I am in favour of in this document, but I will have time to be able to talk about that at this Council.

      "spoken": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will rise and say that I voted to spend the $400,000 to come up with this report and Madam Speaker, just so everybody is clear, I don't blow and suck at the same time, what I am trying to tell you is I have a sincere concern about this document, a sincere concern. It's interesting that when it came along, you know, it's 364 pages. The section that's policy are the strategies, directions and actions that will be taken, Madam Speaker, but in a consultation like for example, Sinclair Park which I couldn't attend, I was busy doing something else at that time, which was in my area, I would point out that there is no way you could go to a consultation and cover off all this stuff and consider all the dynamics related to the maps just in my ward and in the North and West Kildonan where I spent most of my life riding bikes, walking now, taking a bus a whole bit and working as a City Councillor, Madam Speaker, consultation goes on all the time through case work, through consideration. I take a bus, I go out there, I walk, that's what I do. I am up and down Selkirk Avenue and it was great that in the Capital budget, we\u2019ll be fixing those sidewalks. If you want to talk about hell and fear, walk down those things. It\u2019s almost every day I almost twist my ankle. There are people that are getting hurt and so on. So those\u2026I wanted to just speak about the ad campaigns a bit. You\u2019ve got 30 seconds for an ad. We didn't spend a lot of money on it but we knew there was people out there that would have great concerns about this stuff and they did\u2026they weren't at these consultations because the way the consultations work is those people who are really interested in the topic, that's who comes to these things, but the day when you start putting these things down like a raised intersection at Hartford and Powers and you don't warn the people there that there\u2019s going to be buses still, you know, slow down by eight km\/h but hitting a bump at 40 km\/h, it's still shaking their house, okay. That's what happened and in dry years, the excuses\u2026while in dry years when that raised bump wasn't there, that house never cracked. It just started happening in the dry year when the raised intersection is there. So all around Winnipeg, there\u2019s different conditions and stuff and consultations need to get more minuscule, more down to the earth. There was an amendment in here that would really bring it a little more closer to the ground so that people understand what's happening before it starts to get built, but anyway I digress because, Madam Speaker, it's been said that this is a guide. The master transportation plan is a guide, but it's also a policy and in our motions, No. 1, it says that this\u2026Appendix A is our policy and Appendix A refers to the strategies, directions and actions. There is a lot of dialogue and discussion, words in there, verbal words, talking about\u2026actually; you know what's interesting in there? It talks about how important in neighbourhoods that the streets and the sidewalks are safe for people to walk on. So if you\u2019ve got bad condition sidewalks, that's not good. So I\u2019ve got a whole neighbourhood with one green way planned for it, a whole neighbourhood, but in that neighbourhood, there is like\u2026there is tons and tons of just the sidewalks to get you to these special things that they\u2019ve got on these maps here and there is no reference to those conditions. It talks about improved maintenance and it does talk about improving the sidewalks and stuff but there\u2019s no reference. Like, you know, it would have been simple to put it in there, our local street renewal program\u2026programs, actually fix streets so the bikes can ride on them so they are not really bumpy. The sidewalks at the same time get fixed so you can walk to the bus route which might be a green way or might not, but so your sidewalks are safe to get there. We already do a lot of this stuff, but there is no acknowledgment in this document to that at all. I moved a simple amendment to put a sincere, simple amendment to put it in there and it's not in there. You people shut it down. And when I tried to introduce that policy exchange because this document is a policy just like the master transportation plan and every time we try to change one of those, there is a huge issue. It gets crazy and, Madam Speaker, you know dawn well about the master transportation plan and how difficult it is to change that policy, very difficult. In here, we\u2019re telling our administration to do everything they can to implement the strategies, directions and actions within this document. That is what we are voting on, plus, the two amendments. That is what we are voting on. So I want people to understand that new Councillors here need to understand this. I, you know, I proposed\u2026I, you know, I think\u2026I\u2019m sorry I embarrassed some of my cyclists in my ward who were at the consultations and they came with this, but I think they are feeling a little guilty today because I pointed out that they missed the pedestrian needs on Euclid. For some street that doesn't need a green way and you\u2019ll never get a crossing across Main Street there. Nobody is going to do that. Madam Speaker, sincere motions to change the policy even before is adopted in a policy, simple map changes, yes, some of them influenced other people's wards. I did notice that one of the motions I introduced at community committee got favour because somebody could see the benefit for their ward, like, I\u2026I am trying to consider everything. When I propose the amending motions that I did, I considered the need of the pedestrian and cycling needs for the people, Madam Speaker, in your ward and in Councillor Pagtakhan's ward. A sincere\u2026I\u2019m not against it. People keep saying I\u2019m against it. In 140 characters, you cannot define what your position is on this strategic plan on this polity, okay? Neither can you do it in 30 second commercials because I noticed that there\u2019s two amending approaches to two commercials that don\u2019t fully reflect my opinion. But the reality is, we couldn't afford to run a one hour ad to explain and rationalize. So it sounds like fear mongering. It\u2019s not. I\u2019ll tell you what. People with disabilities even on the Access Advisory Committee, Madam Speaker, which we sit like the idea because they think it\u2019s going to work that residents shovel their sidewalks so that they are in good condition so wheelchairs can use it. But I will point out there\u2019s\u2026and this doesn't say they\u2019re going to enact it right away, but it does say we are empowering the administration before the amendment comes, we are empowering the administration to implement the strategy, direction and actions. That means to implement and in there okay, I know the amendments are going to lighten and I think that\u2019s good. I actually will vote for that amendment because my concern is\u2026but what consultation process is going to get those 90 year old women in my ward to it? We have to shovel their windrows all the time, Madam Speaker. ",

There was no consideration to this stuff. The routes decided in the Mynarski Ward don't make sense. And I\u2019m telling you there\u2019s a honest need, and you want to talk about fear, you talk to those parents who are trying to cross Templeton from a pedestrian walkway just to get across the street and go to school. They\u2019ve seen their kids almost get hit. You want to July 15, 2015 talk about fear. I never said that in my commercial. What I said, that\u2019s not fear mongering. This woman who got hit and that lingo, I\u2019m sitting here blind today because I decided to go out one night. You can get hurt anywhere. Every day when I walk in my ward and I cross these busy streets, these stupid constructed places where you\u2019ve got to walk to an island, it would take my life in\u2026at Disraeli and Main over here just by City Hall. There is no way I would cross there because I\u2019d be putting my life in danger, to die, because I would get hit because it\u2019s\u2026you can't navigate it. So to say that I am not sincere, concerning and worrying about the residents of the ward of Mynarski and the citizens of Winnipeg because I am not a parochial person. I voted for Stage 2 Bus Rapid Transit. Most of the people my ward didn\u2019t want it, but it\u2019s got active transportation. It\u2019s good. But I can\u2019t vote for this thing because there is a lot of good people that put a lot of stuff in here, but there\u2019s errors and what you\u2019ve told me today, what\u2019s happened here today, you told me you are not willing to change the policy even through the regular process that's going to have to happen now. It's not going to happen because you won't trust that\u2026at least I have some knowledge and when you send this to the administration who is already overworked and can't do enough to keep up to the reports, we ask for them. You know, think about it because I\u2019m really upset. I think this document could be really good. I am sincere about it but I can't, in good conscience vote for it because I know important amendments that need to happen to it will not happen. ",

And it talks, you know, Madam Speaker, six major pillars in this document and when I quickly look at it, Madam Speaker, you can see there\u2019s a huge focus on improving safety and accessibility. There\u2019s also a huge focus on improving connectivity back in early 1970s, Madam Speaker. Our city, 13 different municipalities came together to form Unicity. This document goes a long way I think in terms of creating that connectivity for our City and to sort of thrusts our City into the future. There is a futurist writer, H.G. Wells and in 1905 he wrote \u201cA Modern Utopia\u201d and he quoted\u2026I\u2019m going to quote him, Madam Speaker, he says, \"Cycle tracks will bound in utopia\u201d, I\u2019m getting some applause and you know, Winnipeg is our utopia. Winnipeg is heaven on earth and we are here shaping our utopia, Madam Speaker. There is a litany of incredible key directions in here. I really want to thank the work of, you know, the industry professionals especially our cycling advocates and the people who took part, the thousands of folks and hundreds of folks and hundreds of youth and new Canadians who took part in this consultation throughout the entire City of Winnipeg. I want to thank the Mayor for his support, Councillor Lukes for her ongoing support even before she was a city Councillor and this Council, Madam Speaker, for the incredible support that they are providing and the words that I have heard in support today regarding this document. So you know, I\u2019ll keep it really short. I also want to thank several of my constituents, Madam Speaker. I got several phone calls. I had received several e- mails and I never received any negative feedback from it. I did receive one person who wrote me, it wasn't in my ward that they weren't in favour of it but resoundingly it was a huge amount of support for this document and support for moving forward on a cycling and pedestrian strategies for our City. I\u2019m excited, Madam Speaker, because there is a lot of new things that we\u2019re going to be taking on within our City and as you know, Madam Speaker, I\u2019m really advocating for the Arlington Bridge and when that gets built within our City, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how we can improve the cycling strategies there, and how we can improve the safety, the connectivity, the, you know, how we can\u2026how we have a physical barrier in our City like rivers and rail roads and how we can cross that in the able, more commerce and connectivity through Pedestrian and Cycling Strategies so that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s one thing that really excites me about this document the most. And I can't say so many enough good things about it.

It\u2019s garbage or whatever. I should just be able to throw out in the garbage can and whatever it is or beside garbage can and somebody will take it away.\u201d So when they do build the I guess you call it, the North District 4R Depot which would be I believe it\u2019s Pacific near McPhillips. It's still a bit of a drive and we just had a discussion about those poor people who don't have motor vehicles including myself. If they have a mattress or whatever, they should be calling 311 and doing it properly but they don't want to pay money. That\u2019s interesting, but so my concern here though is, so I think when the 4R Depots were proposed, the minimum price for say bringing a mattress or a\u2026whatever to one of these 4R Depots would be $5. I note here that we are moving it up to $15 and I just want to caution everybody that these depots will not do what we hope they will do, it's supposed to provide convenience so that you don't have to drive all the way to Brady, so\u2026to get rid of your materials and stuff. So we need to ensure that there is a balance and I know we need to find the money, Councillor Morantz to make sure that we can afford to do these things. But we\u2019ve got to be careful about the balance. What is that price breaking fee that will\u2026like we want to\u2026what we want to do is make sure nobody is dumping. Make it convenient. Make it so that it is not overly expensive and you will get more, right? Like it's\u2026it\u2019s like the more you get, the lower the price, right? Usually, that's how it works, mass marketing. A number of us around the table have had, well, my business was sort of successful till I got into\u2026was successful till I got into politics, but the...many of us have been successful business people. So I just warn\u2026I\u2019ll be voting for this, but I just warn you, if it gets too much higher than the minimum $15, those people who would just drop off that chair or that whatever, they may not be encouraged to do that and they will continue to keep dumping and we can try to catch them, the video cameras are going to help us out in those really problematic areas, but I have to say, it would be nice if nobody dumped crap in our streets, back lanes and in empty lots. So, I will be voting for it. Councillor Lukes, just I caution our administration as we move forward, the price points are very important, thank you. ",

They were sitting vacant. There were lanes out of service but there was no work being done.

The positive fact in the pedestrian and cycling strategy is there is a component where we can do a lot better public communication and awareness, and I think that we will be expanding our communications on use of these facilities, where these facilities are, identifying these facilities, but the bottom line is, cyclists do have a legal right to use the highway and the roads.

That's pretty  self-explanatory  and it was discussed by the ASD Committee back in January. The changes here today reflect the fact that we had considerable feedback from members of the public in regards to what\u2019s being proposed in terms of changes to the downtown evening parking piece. Specifically, the previous council had granted authorization to do a 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. two hour paid parking program which was, at that point supported by the Biz but the ASD Committee and Council and a number of others that were consulted on the item had concerns with that particular proposal. ASD and EPC endorsed the plan to go to a two hour paid program, but there was still concerns with some residents from the Fort Garry Ward\u2026Fort  Rouge-East  Fort Garry Ward which Councillor Gerbasi represents and it\u2019s in the area that the proposed changes were being proposed as well as concerns from some of the members of the BIZ community. I know the Parking Authority and the BIZ have done significant consultation with sessions out Convention Centre years ago and meetings with various business interest and business groups but I think there is an opportunity perhaps to see some other proposals that could come forward to this Council as well as an opportunity to consult with the new Council so everyone\u2019s brought us up to speed as to what the concerns and issues are so the amending motion puts a halt in any changes to even parking for the time being and that that would come back to the ASD Committee in December. So again, we\u2019re\u2026we\u2019re moving forward with the 2015 business plan with the removal of any changes to evening parking until further discussion in December. ",

So during the campaign, of course, many folks didn't believe they lived in the St. Norbert ward and I had to convince them that they do and they need to for me. It was very\u2026a lot of convincing at the door, and I think that the\u2026in consultation with many of the groups in St. Norbert and especially our heritage groups in the actual community of St. Norbert that we\u2019ve come to the conclusion the South  Winnipeg-St.  Norbert Ward would be a more appropriate name for the ward tipping our hat to the heritage and history and significance of St. Norbert by retaining St. Norbert in the name.
