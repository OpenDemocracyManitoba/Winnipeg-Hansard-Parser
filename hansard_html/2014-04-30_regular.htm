<P class="p7 ft1">INTRODUCTION AND WELCOME OF GUESTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</P>
<P class="p6 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Our Page for today's meeting is Elizabeth Walker of Fort Richmond Collegiate who resides in the St. Norbert Ward. Thank you for joining us here today. Mr. Mayor, I understand you have a few announcements today.</P>
<P class="p8 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Yes, I do, Madam Speaker. To start off with, Madam Speaker, the month of May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month. Cystic Fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting Canadian children and young adults, but there is hope. Thanks to investments and CF research and care, Canadians are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. In the 1960s, a child with Cystic Fibrosis was not expected to live long enough to go to kindergarten. Today, 60 percent of Canadians with the disease are living into adulthood. Winnipeggers can join the fight against Cystic Fibrosis by supporting the Great Strides Walk in St. Vital Park on Sunday, May the 25th. I would now like to invite Kayla Hodgins to come forward to speak to us today about her battle with Cystic Fibrosis.</P>
<P class="p9 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Kayla Hodgins: </SPAN>Your Worship Mayor Katz and members of City Council, good morning. My name is Kayla Hodgins. I’m here today representing one of approximately 3400 Canadians living with a fatal disease called Cystic Fibrosis. I am here to proclaim that May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month. Cystic Fibrosis Canada calls on every Canadian to join the fight against CF during the month of May. Each week, two children are diagnosed and one person dies from Cystic Fibrosis. There is no cure. There is cause for hope. Every dollar raised for Cystic Fibrosis research continues to lead to new treatments. Fifty years ago, individuals like me did not live long enough to attend kindergarten. I am committed to helping find a cure and helping to improve the lives of those living with this fatal disease. I have been involved in fundraising events since the age of three. Like every individual with CF I was born with this disease, however, only diagnosed at the age of eight weeks. Now 16 years old, I’m living a relatively healthy life, but it has not been easy. I am fortunate that this disease mainly affects my digestion; however its progression has started to affect my lungs as well. Each and every lung infection I get will take off days of my life. My daily routine is as follows: wake up at 6:00 a.m. to start treatment, through a combination of inhaled medications and breathing exercises. It takes an hour and a half to complete all these meds. Then, and only then, I can get ready for school and eat breakfast. Each and every meal involves taking enzymes between 20 and 30 pill capsules each day. Eight vitamins to keep me healthy and again, in the evening, I begin my medications and breathing exercises. Another hour and a half will go by before I am done. This, in a nutshell, is my life with Cystic Fibrosis. My life revolves around taking enzymes, vitamins, nasal rinses, inhaled medications, breathing exercises. I’ve had four nasal surgeries in seven years and most likely needing one more very shortly. I continue to go to Children's Hospital once every three months to get my…to check my height, weight, perform respiratory tests, blood tests, throat swabs and <NOBR>x-rays.</NOBR> My parents have been heavily involved in our local chapter, the Winnipeg Chapter of Cystic Fibrosis Canada. They decided to get involved because they wanted to meet other parents who had children with CF. My parents wanted to make a difference in the lives of those living with CF. How do they do this? By fundraising, by talking and by just getting involved. On Sunday, May 25th at St. Vital Park, I will be doing my part by participating in our annual walk, great strides walk for Cystic Fibrosis. My team called 65 roses, will be walking to help find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis. Every step we take will bring us that much closer. My team goal is to raise $3,000. Won't you help? I’m hoping you will join me on Sunday, May 25th by donating, by walking and by creating awareness about this terrible disease. I want to find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis so that I don't have to continue taking all this medication. I want to enjoy time with my family and friends while I can. Cystic Fibrosis is a fatal disease. I may lose my life too soon. If we can cure or control, it’s not found in time. One day, soon, CF will stand for cure found. And remember, May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month. Thank you for listening to me and allowing me to share my story.</P>
<P class="p10 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you so much for speaking to us today and raising our awareness. Thank you. Mayor Katz, you have some other announcements to make?</P>

<P class="p14 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Yes, I do, Madam Speaker. I rise to acknowledge Public Rail Safety Week taking place across Canada from April the 28th to May the 4th. The purpose of this national week is to raise rail safety awareness among all Canadians, led by Operation Lifesaver. Operation Lifesaver is a partnership initiative of the Railway Association of Canada and Transport Canada and works in <NOBR>co-operation</NOBR> with the rail industry, governments, police services, the media and the public to raise rail safety awareness. Its goal is to prevent collisions between trains and motor vehicles and trespassing incidents. Every year in Canada, approximately 300 collisions and trespassing incidents occur at railway crossings and along railway tracks with approximately <NOBR>one-third</NOBR> of these incidents resulting in the death or serious injury. On behalf of City Council, I would like to thank Operation Lifesaver for its ongoing efforts to save lives and prevent injuries in Canadian communities including Winnipeg. As well, Madam Speaker, as you I’m sure know, May the 5th is Melanoma Monday. And in a demonstration of support, the courtyard at City Hall will be lit up in orange, helping to put the spotlight on skin cancer. Melanoma is the less common form of skin cancer but is the most dangerous. It is being estimated that the lifetime risk for developing melanoma is one in 74. But if diagnosed early, it is one of the highest cure rates of all cancers at more than 90 percent. Raising awareness for the necessary steps to prevent skin cancer is crucial in the fight to decrease the number of individuals affected by melanoma. I encourage Winnipeggers to join City Hall and cities all across Canada on Melanoma Monday by wearing orange, supporting the hope that one day there will be a world without skin cancer. And Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge that May the 9th will be National Day of Honour marking the end of Canada's mission in Afghanistan. The purpose of this day is to pay respects to those returning from Afghanistan, those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and those who have been wounded in the line of duty. And in addition to the brave men and women of the Canadian armed forces that they also recognizes the families of these brave individuals as well as the contributions made by Canada's law enforcement and civil society. This day of honour will be observed across the country with a national ceremony occurring on parliament hill with veterans and their families from all branches of the Canadian armed forces present. The end of the mission in Afghanistan marks the end of a generational mission that affected many people in Winnipeg. These individuals have earned our respect and deserve our recognition. On behalf of City Council, I would like to thank the brave men and women in the Canadian armed forces who have made personal sacrifices while performing their duties in Afghanistan. Madam Speaker, I ask that Council observe a moment of silence.</P>

<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Nordman, I understand you have an announcement today as well.</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Nordman: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yes, it's my pleasure to stay up and recognize something of a more happy vein and say thank you to the committee that hosted the Juno Awards, since our last Council meeting. The team led by Carole Vivier, Kenny Boyce, Rob Kristjansson, Kevin Walters did an outstanding job on behalf of our city when millions of citizens from across country watched the actual awards ceremony on TV and we were thrilled with the work that the Public Works Department did at a most difficult time of year to make our city look any way half decent at least in the downtown area. They made a colossal effort to you know clean up the area around the MTS Centre. So congratulations to all the folks including…at the awards, the nomination and awarding of the Hall of Fame to our own <NOBR>Bachman-Turner</NOBR> Overdrive. So thank you very much to the committee.</P>

<P class="p26 ft6">that advocates for affordable housing for low income people. The coalition began in 2005 when concerned citizens came together to try to find a temporary use of the empty houses at Kapyong Barracks. After learning about the critical shortage of housing for low income people throughout the city, the group expanded its mandate in 2006 to speak out about the need for more affordable housing throughout the city. Since that time, many individuals and organizations have joined the coalition to support the position that all levels of government have a role to play to end housing insecurity and homelessness. The lack of accordable rental housing has been the focus of our advocacy efforts in recent years. Too many citizens of Winnipeg are struggling to find decent affordable housing. The situation is particularly acute for Winnipeggers who wish to rent. Although we have recently seen improvement in the overall vacancy rate, the situation is still difficult with a 1.4 percent vacancy rate for a one bedroom apartment. The number of rental units when compared to the population has continued to decline. Rental costs are increasing and incomes have not kept pace with housing costs. The coalition has lobbied the Provincial Government to increase the supply of social housing to meet the needs of people with very low income. Our efforts at the Federal level have been to lobby for taxation changes that would stimulate private market rental development. In a March 2010 position paper presented to the Winnipeg Housing Steering Committee. The Right to Housing Coalition advocated for an expanded role for the City regarding affordable rental housing and called for the development and implementation of an affordable rental housing strategy. The coalition was pleased that Council approved a housing policy last September that identified the lack of affordable housing development as a key issue and established a leadership role for the City in working with other levels of government, housing developers and community organizations to increase the supply. One of the stated objectives of the City's policy is to encourage new housing development that establishes a sufficient supply of affordable, adequate and suitable housing throughout the city that meets the needs of the population of Winnipeg. The proposed implementation plan sets key goals. One of which is to facilitate development to support a healthy rental vacancy of three percent and targets new units of rental housing with the minimum number of units to be affordable. The plan also provides for the development of housing incentive programs, a measure the coalition has been recommending to the City as a critical component of an affordable housing strategy. The coalition has lobbied for a strategy for Winnipeg that would involve all three levels of government. The proposed plan outlines several areas of collaboration with the province, including the development of an affordable housing strategy with the province. Stacking of incentives offered at the city and provincial level will encourage development. The plan indicates that the City will advocate for changes to Federal legislation to create a more enabling environment for rental development. The coalition strongly supports this advocacy role. The City’s “Our Winnipeg” and “Complete Communities” planning documents and the approved Winnipeg Housing Policy support a leadership role for the City to achieve a healthy housing environment that meets the needs of Winnipeggers. The implementation plan being considered today expands on the policy, providing actions to support the City's role in housing. The Right to Housing Coalition supports the approval of the plan and recommends that the Public Service be directed to take action on the plan as a priority activity of the City. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Are there any questions for Miss Testar? Okay, thank you. Next is Mr. David Sanders in opposition to the same item. Welcome. You have ten minutes, sir.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">David Sanders: </SPAN>Thank you. Madam Speaker and members of Council, my name is David Sanders and I am appearing this morning as a private citizen to speak briefly in opposition to the proposal to consider establishing a transportation transit development agency and…</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Mr. Sanders. I believe you are speaking to the City of Winnipeg Housing Policy Implementation Plan.</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">David Sanders: </SPAN>And in opposition to the serious short comings of whole City of Winnipeg Housing Policy Implementation Plan.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>And we’ll get to the other item after we take questions on this one. Is that okay?</P>
<P class="p20 ft1">David Sanders: <SPAN class="ft2">Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p16 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Yes, thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p31 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">David Sanders: </SPAN>Thank you. I am most opposed to many other items on your agenda, but I’ve already registered my concerns about them at previous Standing Policy Committee meetings, but with respect to the City of Winnipeg Housing Policy Implementation Plan, let me begin by saying that I am strongly in favour of the City of Winnipeg finally assuming a major leadership role in the development and delivery of programs and services designed to ensure that all residents of Winnipeg enjoy affordable, adequate and suitable housing throughout the city. But I am afraid that what we're doing, we’re going to disappoint a lot of people once again, if this <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> implementation plan is the best we can do. I hope that Council will debate the matter this morning and then refer the document back to the Housing Steering Committee with a request that it produce and resubmit a real implementation plan and budget to Council before the end of June. The document before you now is little more than a restatement of the new Winnipeg housing policy which was adopted</P>

<P class="p32 ft6">by Council over the objection of Councillors Fielding and Wyatt last September. That housing policy statement is already out of date as it failed to highlight the City's important role now as administrator of the funds available from the Federal Government’s Homelessness Partnering Strategy since April, 2012. Nevertheless, the new policy did accept municipal responsibility to achieve a supply of affordable, adequate and suitable housing throughout the city and to meet the core housing need of our citizens who are presently unable to attain such housing. And more specifically, the City identified the encouragement of residential development in the downtown as a key priority. The City commits to encourage an increase and supply our rental units in more dense and affordable housing throughout Winnipeg, and especially in the <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> reinvestment areas which are to be a subset of the mature areas located around downtown, but even today are not yet designated officially. The housing policy does support the development of comprehensive neighbourhood housing assessments and plans by community partners and the continuation of the City’s Housing, Rehabilitation Investment Reserve Fund. Note that while the policy acknowledges the ongoing value of the Winnipeg Housing Rehabilitation Corporation in providing housing for persons with low or modest income, there is no suggestion that its role be expanded. When the housing policy was adopted last September, Council asked for the development of an implementation plan, within four months. Seven months later, we now have this document. I suggest that any implementation plan for a major program such as this should provide a comprehensive outline that defines scope and goals, financial and staff resources required, scheduled activities, scheduled activity durations and actual project status. It should make clear what the specific objectives are, how they will be achieved and when we may expect the desired results. It should be reasonable and should be believable. There are only a few very…very few target figures in this document without any supporting analysis. There’s no designated areas, no budgets, no staffing plans, no schedules notifying funding formulas, no eligibility criteria. There’s no evidence here that the City administration has any idea on how to implement effective housing programs on a significant scale. Now, I do know that the many organizations who are concerned about housing, especially in the inner city, will be urging you to approve this plan now as just the previous speaker, even though they can't hide their disappointment at the lack of specifics. The Right to Housing Coalition, which you just heard from representing some 50 organizations, has recommended previously the EPC approved the plan quickly so that actions outlined in the plan can be taken by the City to address the critical lack of affordable housing in Winnipeg. Earlier, the coalition did advise the Housing Steering Committee that "given the urgency of the problem in our city, the coalition was disappointed that the implementation plan did not contain more specific incentive program information." The Social Planning Council also supported the policy commitment to an affordable housing strategy with financial incentives, planning tools, regulatory incentives and adequate staff resources. However, the Council advised the Housing Steering Committee that, and I quote, “this is not such a strategy, but it's an important first step”. The Canadian Community Economic Development Network Manitoba advised the steering committee that "to be meaningful, this policy must be accompanied by an implementation plan that is based on the policy and that is adequately funded to meet the need.” And they note, (inaudible) did state that the present City Housing Rehabilitation Investment Reserve Fund, of just over $1 million is not sufficient to address the current situation given the severity of Winnipeg’s supportable rental housing shortage. And when I try to understand why the promise of a new housing policy looks like it will fizzle out so quickly, I do find some clues when the housing policy experts at Myers Norris Penny were retained to conduct a public consultation process and draft the policy in 2012, I see their mandate did not include the preparation of strategies or actions or funding or procedures or guidelines. Not one person attended their public forum and no one provided any comments through the Speak Up Winnipeg website and a number of very important community and industry housing organizations did not attend either of the two, only two, focus group dates which were offered. On the other hand, just yesterday, the 14 member Community Task Force to End Homelessness, which was formed through the leadership of the United Way, published its own plan including detailed performance targets and action plans for years one through four. It also lacks a budgetary framework as well, but it does reflect the serious intent of the task force members to encourage and actually reduce and then end homelessness in our city. Now, last week, I suggested that the City of Winnipeg is now, if the City of Winnipeg is now, finally willing to play a major role in leading the development from the implementation of specific multilevel housing strategies with the Federal, Provincial, community and industry partners then let's get on with it. We need a financial commitment far beyond the 1.2 million in the Housing Rehabilitation Investment Reserve Fund. We need to identify specific neighbourhoods, building and rehab sites, minimum affordable housing policies, concrete details of financial incentives and the public commitment required to ensure private owners and developers that the community visions will in fact be realized. I know it's not easy. I was a member of the Board of the Manitoba Housing Renewal Corporation when the Province was building family and elderly person’s housing as fast as we could and much later I had the privilege of helping the citizens involved with Flora Place, the West Broadway Community Land Trust, Kekinan Centre and the North End Community Renewal Corporation. As the City now works with the many interested parties and there are many, it should be possible to construct a real implementation plan and budget which we can all understand and believe in. Last Saturday, Bartley Kives of the Winnipeg Free Press provided a civic election preview in which he said and I quote, “Every Mayoral and Council candidate will pay lip service to improving Winnipeg for all of its citizens including the vulnerable impoverish population. Pay no attention to what they say as they will do almost nothing to address social inequality between elections. I would really like this Council to prove him wrong and refer this document back to the Housing Steering Committee with the request that they produce and resubmit a real implementation plan and budget to Council before the end of June. Thank you, Madam Chair.</P>

<P class="p25 ft1">April 30, 2014</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any questions? Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, Madam Chairperson. My question to the delegation is…one mentioned the United Way’s strategic plan to end homelessness, not manage it. And I was just wondering if Mr. Sanders was aware that the City participated in a number of the consultations and discussions with the United Way Group looking to end homelessness and is he aware of that and that the City is trying to offer what it can under its existing budgetary situation to deal with the ending of homelessness?</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Mr. Sanders.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">David Sanders: </SPAN>Yes, Councillor Eadie, I understand that the City's Director of Community Services is a member of that task force. I presume has participated fully in its work and I understand the Mayor joined in the announcement yesterday and certainly if you’re going to deal with homelessness, since the City is the administrator of the Federal funds involved it's not going to happen unless the City is deeply involved in that program. You realize that the housing policy that you adopted last fall didn't anticipate that at all.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions?</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Just a subsequent question to that. It’s just simply…so the measurement of a budgetary item I believe the City of Winnipeg puts a million dollars into housing, but specifically, is Mr. Sanders aware that we don't necessarily measure the employee hours that are put into ending homeless strategy as part of the costs or contribution we make to trying to end homelessness.</P>
<P class="p36 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">David Sanders: </SPAN>Councillor, I appreciate that if the City does measure it, you don't publish it. You did publish the fact that you have five equivalent <NOBR>full-time</NOBR> employees retained at the Federal expense to administer the new partnership program, but apart from that the right…the Social Planning Council referred to the housing division as being tiny and I suspect that it is, for the task that we're giving them. And I would like to see more people with talent on the City payroll to work in the leadership role coordinating these housing programs and policies from both other governments and of course the very many organizations which are doing good things on their own as it is.</P>
<P class="p22 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further questions for Mr. Sanders? Seeing none, we'll move on to the next item. Mr. Sanders is in opposition to Item 3 of the Report of EPC dated April 9, 2014 dealing with the transit development agency. Mr. Sanders, I wish to remind you that the decision Council is dealing with today is a referral of this item to the Public Service for 90 days rather than the merits of the item itself. As such, you should only be speaking to the referral and not to the merits. You will have a chance to come back to the merits of the item when the item comes back to Council in about 90 days.</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">David Sanders: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Since the consequence of this resolution is to devote City of Winnipeg staff resources to a task, it seems to me, it ought to be at least debatable in that respect. And my recommendation is that Council not approve an administrative study of this suggestion to establish a new transit development agency that will be able to facilitate, coordinate and spearhead transit oriented development.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Do you have anything to say about the referral, sir?</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">David Sanders: </SPAN>I’m opposing it and suggesting Council should not adopt it.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>It will be debated, you know, at the time, at the place it's referred. So do you have anything to say about the referral?</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">David Sanders: </SPAN>Well, Madam, you have a copy of my remarks and if you think it doesn't deal with that, then…</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Well, I see some of them are cut off here. So do you have anything to say about the referral, sir?</P>
<P class="p31 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">David Sanders: </SPAN>Well, what was not cut off, what was not censored that says that perhaps the Councillors proposing this imagine that the creation of a <NOBR>semi-independent</NOBR> transit corridor development agency will wrest control from the senior Civic officials, consulting engineering firms, developers and construction enterprises which now seem determined to undertake perversely development oriented transit projects at huge public expense. I’m referring of course most recently to the 590 million capital integration project which includes the <NOBR>ill-fated</NOBR> southwest rapid transit corridor and is apparently the subject of some heated debate behind closed doors. I think that war is too important to leave to the generals and public transit is too important to leave to the private developers and/or the senior Civic officials. Rather than create still another Civic authority to operate beyond public oversight and control, I would suggest that EPC and Council regain</P>

<P class="p41 ft1">Moved by Councillor Smith,</P>
<P class="p41 ft1">Seconded by Councillor Eadie,</P>
<P class="p28 ft11">WHEREAS the Government of Canada has introduced Bill <NOBR>C-23,</NOBR> the <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> Fair Elections Act, which is currently before parliamentary committee;</P>
<P class="p30 ft11">AND WHEREAS the proposed changes, which are described by the Federal Government as “sweeping”, include:</P>
<P class="p42 ft11"><SPAN class="ft11">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft12">Rescinding the </SPAN><NOBR>hard-fought</NOBR> right of Canadians without ID to vote through vouching</P>

<P class="p44 ft13"><SPAN class="ft13">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft14">Forbidding the Chief Election Officer from educating citizens about these changes and any other proactive education on the voting process in Canada</SPAN></P>
<P class="p43 ft13"><SPAN class="ft13">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft14">Increasing the contribution limit by 25% and exempting some expenses from spending limits</SPAN></P>
<P class="p45 ft13"><SPAN class="ft13">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft14">Introducing bias into the oversight of the voting process by allowing the governing party to recommend names for poll supervisors</SPAN></P>
<P class="p45 ft11"><SPAN class="ft11">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft12">Removing the ability of the Chief Election Officer to enforce penalties against those found to have violated the Act;</SPAN></P>
<P class="p46 ft11">AND WHEREAS these changes were proposed with no public consultation and with only an <NOBR>hour-long</NOBR> meeting with the federal Chief Election Officer who has subsequently publicly critized the Act;</P>
<P class="p28 ft11">AND WHEREAS these changes would have major impacts on voter participation, including directly disenfranchising 120,000 voters who were able to vote in the last federal election as a result of vouching, and make it even harder for the 500,000 Canadians who say they did not vote in the last federal election because they lacked sufficient ID;</P>
<P class="p40 ft11">AND WHEREAS any changes that undermines voter turnout and confidence in the integrity of the democratic process at any level of government has a negative impact on all levels of government;</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">THEREFORE BE IT RESOVLED that the City of Winnipeg write a letter to local MP’s, the Minister of Democratic Reform and the Prime Minister stating opposition to Bill <NOBR>C-23,</NOBR> the <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> Fair Elections Act, based on the provisions which are likely to reduce voter turnout and confidence in the integrity of the democratic process;</P>
<P class="p47 ft11">AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the City of Winnipeg call upon the federal government to conduct <NOBR>country-wide</NOBR> public hearings to allow Canadians and experts to make submissions on measures to improve electoral accountability and transparency, and increase voter turnout.</P>

<P class="p20 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mr. Mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I would love to hear from the Councillor, please.</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. What we are doing here today is essentially filing this motion and I think that this idea isn't the be <NOBR>all-end</NOBR> all, but we saw and we continue to have a number of citizens without water due to frozen pipes and I think this was one small gesture that we could’ve at least taken the time to cost out. I don't think that that was an onerous expectation, and in fact, this was the Mayor's idea that he spoke about. He was on a <NOBR>call-in</NOBR> radio show and someone had suggested it, and I think it would’ve been part of a bigger plan that the City of Winnipeg need to addressing this same kind of a crisis that we likely could anticipate in the future. So I do think that my hope would be that this would be referred into a bigger part of a plan on how we could accommodate people better who had lost their water, and I heard numerous times that didn't hear from one person. I can tell you that I had heard, people stopped me in the grocery store, people <NOBR>e-mailed</NOBR> me, people called me and said yes, you know what, it would’ve been nice to have that available. So to not even cost it out, I think is very disappointing. So thank you for the opportunity to speak on it and I’m sure it’ll just pass here today.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’m the person, the politician who moved the motion back to Executive Committee last time for the simple reason that we had zero information on the motion. I am not against doing with the motion instructed if there is a need, Madam Speaker. At the time, there was zero information in front of us, it was not determined that there was a need, but I am a little disappointed that the Executive Committee…there’s…this is essentially the same motion here today that we had a month ago. I know…and Councillor Havixbeck is right, the first I heard of that…of this initiative being a possibility came from our current Mayor in an interview who said that we were very close to moving forward on this initiative. So, my question would be what sort of…what sort of work have we done to establish that this is not necessary? We do have social service workers on staff. At least, we did before the last budget. I know there was initially an initiative to cut them. I believe we still have a few of them on staff who would’ve been ideal to go out and determine whether this really is necessary or this is just something that came out of the blue sky or the left field or in Councillor Havixbeck's point, the right field. Sorry, I digress. So I don't think this is a bad idea if the need is there but the problem I’m having this month is the same problem I had last month that there is absolutely</P>

<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p57 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, thank you, Madam Speaker. Well, I was very supportive of this motion when it was brought a month ago and it is a month ago and it is disappointing that nobody really did the research as Councillor Vandal has mentioned so I won't really go into that in great detail. But…and there still is a possibility, what I would say is, and we see this when there’s disasters, recently we heard people with Fisher River overflowing on Peguis Reserve, different places, they put up hotel rooms because when there’s…well, flooding is one thing, but the point is, is when you don't have a way of keeping hygiene and taking care of those kind of very personal needs, really, you shouldn't really be in that house and you should have an opportunity, maybe to put in a hotel room to deal with that kind of thing, but...so, that’s there. Now, I must say though, it's a month later, no research is there. If we were even to, you know, defeat this file, this is information and try to go back, by the time we get there, there won't be a need for hotel rooms because, I noted and this is a really good thing, you know, there’s been great difficulties, there’s well over 2500 cases of frozen pipes. There’s still a lot of people on temporary water, but I noticed in our last announcement from our administration that the City’s been working very hard and we’re down to…you know, I think at one point, we’re over eight, around 700 something households who had no temporary water supply. They might’ve been getting bottles of water whatever that is, but no temporary water supply. It was over 700 for sure. We’re down to 259, I believe, and since last Friday the report came out yesterday, but from the previous Friday, over that period of time, well over 150 homes had their frozen water pipes restored. So in that sense, the City has been responding that way and we’re down to about 259 and I understand one of our pieces of equipment is broken. But I expect to see these over a three day or whatever period that we’re going to see more and more of these 259 homes, I believe it is, with frozen water pipes come off the grid and those are the people who would’ve needed the hotel rooms without having a temporary supply. So while I was wholly in support of this thing, I think at this point, I don't see any use really, to continue debating or discussing it and I guess I’ll have to vote to just accept the report as is, but just with this thing that’s you know, we didn't take the opportunity to provide this, it's really too bad, but I think that in the next, at the current rate, in two weeks, we should have no households with frozen pipes that don't have a temporary water supply. So I’ll leave it at that. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p58 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes followed by Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p31 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think it's important to highlight a couple of things. I mean, I think all of us would like to do all things for all people, sometimes that's just not financially possible. We have a motion here in front of us, from some of the same people who were very upset that we had a property tax increase and indicated that we should be cutting spending and that savings should be found in order to prevent any sort of property tax increase and here is an unfunded motion. We have no idea what the cost is. No idea what the uptake would be so, what are we doing for people if we aren't doing this? Well, as Councillor Eadie touched on a couple of things, certainly we’ve had the firefighters and the paramedics providing water to people. We've had in terms of hygiene, we've had the swimming pool facilities open, I think that was your initiative, Madam Speaker, to help people out in that regard. So you know, I was out door knocking on Arden Avenue the other day. I came across a couple of houses that were hooked up to their neighbours and I said to the one woman, who is the neighbour supplying the water, thank you for doing that that's being a good neighbour and her response was, "Well, yeah", as if this is just the most obvious thing that, that of course you help your neighbour out. That's what you do. You are a good Winnipegger, you’re a good St. Vitaler, you’re a good neighbour. So I think, I think we need to comment on that. A lot of people have come through to help their neighbours out. As Councillor Eadie said, we've hooked up hundreds of people with temporary water supplies. The list of people without water is gradually coming down. The other night, a woman on St. Vital Road, very upset and didn't want to hook up to the neighbours next to her, wanted her pipes thawed out. She’d been out, without water for weeks, and I’ve talked to her, talked with 311. We’re trying to get her some service, so there are some very angry people out there because they haven’t had water. Some of them declined to hook up to their neighbours which is unfortunate, but by and large, as Councillor Eadie had said, we’ve had hundreds of people get hooked up to their neighbours, the water is flowing. We’ve done the initiatives with the swimming pools; we’ve done the initiatives with the firefighters and the paramedics. I mean, I’m sure Councillor Havixbeck is accurate in saying, she’s had people come up to her in her ward and talked about hotels. I must admit I don’t think I’ve had a single person talked to me, even the people whose doors I’ve knocked on, have not said, “Hey, I shouldn’t be here. I should be at a hotel”. They’ve said, “Look, you know, I’ve got kids at school. I want to stay here.” At least, we’ve got the water flowing. It's not high pressure, but the City is getting to it. We are excavating some pipes, streets like Glenview where we’ve had the problems over, year after year, they’re coming, the City is going to come in and lower the pipes, do some excavation work. So it's a product of what happens when you have the coldest winter in 116 years and you know maybe it’s unfortunate that we couldn't put up everybody in a hotel, but I think what is commendable is the City is taking action, the City is doing a lot of different things to try to get the problem dealt with, and we should have a serious discussion here at the end of this. Do we need more of the thawing machines? Are they still being made? All of those sorts of issues need to be seriously canvassed in the budget. So we</P>

<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I just want to make a quick point here. You know, we've looked after the situation quite well I believe. You know, we’ve got immediate access to water for people and the thing that most people are forgetting when they start talking about things like providing hotel rooms: we prioritize how we do the thawing of these pipes. You know, if there is an urgent need, we’re there right away. And so, you know, that's where you might need a hotel room is that if there’s an urgent need. The rest seems to be, some sort of more of trying to buy something from somebody by giving them something for nothing. It doesn't make sense to me. So, you know, we respond on a priority basis that priorities are clearly laid out. We're not leaving anybody high and dry and this work is getting done and for most people, they’ve adapted quite well and if they can’t, we’ve got people that can go out there and they’re willing to go out there and help them adapt and move them on that priority list as required.</P>
<P class="p60 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Seeing no further speakers, all those in favour of Item…pardon me, Mayor, Mr. Mayor to close.</P>
<P class="p61 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I appreciate the comments. I’m not going to repeat. I think Councillor Mayes put most of it…said everything about as well as it can be said, but I will add something. When this came up, this whole idea did not originate from yours truly. I’ve always said that if a good idea comes from a citizen or member of Council or the media, it's something we would look at. Obviously, it's something we did look at and, you know it appears that also the sincerity of why you’re doing this, I spoke to well over half of Council and no one had received one request from anybody who want to stay in a hotel, it was exactly the opposite. They want to stay at their home and they want to get their water hooked up either temporarily or on a <NOBR>full-time</NOBR> basis as quickly as possible. There is very little doubt in my mind that the City is doing everything they can. I think there were things that we could’ve moved on quicker. This is the first time we’ve gone through this type of emergency situation and I can assure you that if it happens again, the City will be much better prepared.</P>

<P class="p66 ft15">Winnipeg and one thing I know is that Our Winnipeg had extensive consultation, community consultation, public input and contemplating this change without…within the policy of that nature needs to be done within an environmental consultation. This wraps into a larger picture of how to manage the growth in our city. And I would ask that we consider addressing this infill with…or this strategy to address infill within a larger environment. As we know, Our Winnipeg has passed and has a five year mandated update and review and that would be in 2016. We are seeing patterns in development where the demand is reached beyond the projected demand estimates. Last year, was the first year that multifamily growth was higher in fact than single family homes. The report identifies that the growth would be 200,000 in population over 23 years. That is driving a need for a 100,000 homes or in the next year, 4348 homes because Winnipeg is not generally subject to the significant fluctuations that other major cities see. So I’m looking for where is the real strategy for addressing that. This identifies 112 potential infill lots out of a need of 4348 homes according to these numbers. My concern about <NOBR>by-stepping</NOBR> or <NOBR>side-stepping</NOBR> the servicing is that this becomes a slippery slope that future generations in our city will have to pay for. I think of areas in <NOBR>Charleswood-Tuxedo</NOBR> Ward, south of Wilkes, where house after house is being built without the required servicing. And I encourage all Councillors and members of the public to try to drive streets like Loudoun, Liberty, Charleswood Road, they are simply not drivable. Ten permits were issued since 2011 for new large homes along one street that I just named. Nearly 200 homes in this area do not have City of Winnipeg water and sewer servicing. And in my opinion, this piece of policy continues to perpetuate that kind of growth and it's really unsustainable. If you support building infill with more services, this will become the result in more areas of our city and I have significant concerns about it. One infill in <NOBR>Charleswood-Tuxedo</NOBR> Ward is very clearly not through on this map. We’ve approved and have in our transportation master plan, the William Clement Parkway extension, and the extension is supposed to go eventually through the RM of Macdonald and connect in to Bishop Grandin. And right now, we have an infill home along that route. Why would we approve the allowance of a building of a new home along a major route? So I’m having significant problems coming to terms with supporting this. I don't see why we would approve a permit to build a new home along a route. There is a star there. You know, I haven't had this broken down by the department with me as the area Councillor. Infill is very important in our city. The servicing should be there and that's the whole rational for infill is that the servicing is there and it should be at a minimal cost, but I think that we…what we are doing here is perpetuating an indefinite deferred maintenance that will eventually need to be paid for. We will eventually need to pave some of these roads. We will eventually need to put in proper water and sewer and proper drainage on lands. And so knowingly, approving this without those kinds of services, to me, is unconscionable and defeats our efforts to make planned sustainable growth move forward properly. We are two years out from mandated Our Winnipeg update. I don’t know why we wouldn't wait to have this come forward as a bigger strategy to manage the extensive growth that we would need. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p28 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I can't believe the area…the Councillor who just spoke did not come and talk to me prior to today's meeting, or maybe she didn't even read the report before us here today. This is to support residential infill subdivision proposals creating lots of frontages on roads, just on roads with less than the full range of Municipal Services. This would require full water and sewer services to be available on the lots that we’re talking about. This is really hypocritical of the Councillor for <NOBR>Charleswood-Tuxedo.</NOBR> She was at the last Property meeting…</P>

<P class="p16 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p31 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>I apologize for the comment, but she was at the last meeting requesting a subdivision of a lot on a road that even was…she was requesting a road standard less than what our Director of Public Works is requesting, which again, I think is unfair and unjust. Anyways, this is to create 112 lots on roads where you’re not likely to have the ability to provide a…you’re not likely to be able to put forward a successful plan of a…sorry, local improvement plan because the streets are basically already fully developed out. This is again very, very limited circumstance. We’ve talked about 112 lots throughout the city. I’ve got streets in my ward, for example, like Bonner Avenue, McIvor Avenue, back in the 80s when they allowed water and sewer…when local improvements went in to do water and sewer, they allowed a limited amount of subdivision to make a couple of these streets logically complete. They did a handful of subdivisions. There was one street that only recently got water and sewer during my term on Council. Again, we're not talking about creating new subdivisions with a full range of Municipal standards, we're talking about just a small amount of infill. Our property and development department went out. They did a very thorough GIS analysis in the entire city to find a consistency like…they saw the logic on what was being proposed, but didn't want to create…they did not want to create</P>

<P class="p69 ft4">a new standard that would allow it for haphazard development without a full range of Municipal services. That’s not where this was going in the least. This was to find those limited instances where a local improvement wouldn't make sense because of, you know, all people fronting it would not be in favour of it, but allowing orderly completion of older neighbourhoods, you know, <NOBR>pre-Unicity</NOBR> neighbourhoods, that again, have put in water and sewer. They identify throughout the entire City of Winnipeg, 112 locations where this was the case. Flag lots and places like Knowles Avenue up in my ward. So again, this is not opening the flood gates in the least towards haphazard development. This is not inconsistent. This is again just a very small piece to logically complete some development throughout the city.</P>
<P class="p70 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Councillor Browaty. And thank you for apologizing. It's important that we debate matters in a respectful manner in this chamber at all times. Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p61 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I won't get into anyone else's position on this. It’s…we get pressured, we get criticized all the time for not approving infill housing. Here we have something that's been a product of a lot of work by our staff, a lot of technical work, I want to commend Braden Smith from the Planning Department on this because I was asking, oh, wait a minute. I’ve got all sort of roads that are chip sealed, not paved, I’ve got Lavalee, I’ve got parts of Carriere, I’ve got parts of Avalon, no, but they don't fit under certain another criteria because there is no…Lavalee doesn’t have the piped in sewer. So there’s reasons why this list is this list, and I’m sure Councillor Havixbeck can go forward, only one of the three areas is in her ward. I know there is a lot of work there. If you take a look at the precincts, I think Councillor Vandal has two precincts, I have none. Councillor Havixbeck must have a half dozen out there. So there’s a lot of development and Madam Speaker, you’ve got a couple yourself I think in terms of the future development of the city, a lot of it’s going to be in the Charleswood area, a lot of work there to be done, but this I think is a relatively small initiative that makes sense. It's looking at subdivision. It's looking at trying to create some opportunities for housing where, as Councillor Browaty has said, we might have abandoned in the past because the road was chip sealed out, but we’ve got a lot of development on chip sealed roads right now. Frankly, go south of the Perimeter, we’ve got all sorts of, in my ward, we’ve got all sorts of houses on gravel road and we're building more. So I think there may be some technical issues here, some misunderstanding about how things got on a list, but I think it's a good initiative to try to start building some infill housing.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Mr. Mayor to…pardon me, Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Thank you. I just…I’ll be very brief. I’m always brief. I’m always brief, but I’ll be briefer than usual. I think that Councillor Havixbeck brings forward some interesting thoughts and there’s been some good conversation on this, but I just want to make the point that there will be a public hearing if I’m reading the report properly. This is giving first reading to an initiative where there is a public hearing at Executive Committee where those who want to…who want to come forward and express their concern with where this is going, that is the opportunity to do it. You’re going to have people there that are…think this is a great initiative. Others who think it's not a positive initiative for a city, so theoretically, there is an opportunity for input here and there…theoretically, we could come back with a recommendation that Executive Committee and this Council can in fact vote this down when this comes back for second reading if the case is made and I’m not sure if the case is there, but it's an interesting issue and I’m glad that we’ve had this discussion on this matter. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Seeing none, Mr. Mayor to close.</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think the first comment that I’d like to make is there was a full and thorough analysis done by the department, that's number one. And through you to Councillor Havixbeck is the comment about housing south of Wilkes, that's not part of this policy, just for the record. I think the previous speakers have basically addressed why this is here. I’m not going to be redundant. I am definitely in support of it.</P>

<P class="p72 ft1">Item 1 - City of Winnipeg Housing Policy Implementation plan</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I think we all know what this is all about. I would love to hear from the Councillors and I’d be happy to comment or respond.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie followed by Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p17 ft15"><SPAN class="ft16">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes. Sorry, I’m…thank you, Madam Speaker. I’ll be a little cryptic on this because I can't cite exactly where in the report this is, but it talks about neighbourhood revitalization and us using our housing reserve fund to help revitalize neighbourhoods and I think that's really quite laudable. I am in support of this implementation plan. Yeah, it would be nice to say we’re throwing some budgetary…more budgetary money towards this stuff. But…so, I am supportive of all this though, but I need to say when it talks about the neighbourhood revitalization and it talks about…that is really important and making investments in neighbourhoods where the housing stock is really falling apart. We know that many of our vacant and derelict buildings issues exist in the inner city market region as they call it. And you know, we need to make sure that that housing stock is good and is providing for the people. And it talks about the measurement though of these actual areas in terms of measuring assessment based on an average or above average of the market changes in assessment. Now, that's interesting because technically you can measure it right now. I’ve done the research study and what it points out is, is that in the inner city, the market value assessments of the inner city homes has gone up so much that its share of the property tax pie has increased by 52 percent. Whereas other neighbourhoods are looking at 23 percent share in the property tax pie. So, in terms of measuring this, I think specifically, we need to measure the value of specific homes in terms of…its…the shape that these homes are in. But, based on our reassessment process where you see that for example, other properties assessment, their share of the property tax pie over the last five years, has gone down two percent because of the reassessment. Apartment blocks which reflects the problem that we have with housing in terms of the cost, the affordability, has gone up their share of the property tax…it’s gone up 54 percent and their assessments are based on their ability to raise revenues and so you can see that apartments are very expensive to rent. We have an affordability problem and the residential one properties, 21 percent…20 percent increase in its share of the property tax pie, in terms of increased property taxes and that, but what I’m really trying to say here is that my research study shows that reassessment and valuing homes based on that market value really leave us with I think a problematic situation because 52 percent share of the property tax pie for the <NOBR>inner-city,</NOBR> that means that this City government is taking way more money out of areas where they need to keep their money because you’re creating asset wealth, but they’re all cash poor. This is the homeless problem. Lots of this is happening, all across the city in mature neighbourhoods. So while I’m looking at this, I think that the implementation is trying to deal with our housing problem for people who are looking for affordable housing. Though when we’re making decisions about how we reassess and how we assess homes for property tax purposes, we really need to take into consideration what effect is that having on this homelessness problem? What effect is that having on people’s ability to remain living there? Because, yeah, you can sell the asset but then where are you going to live? You can't afford to pay the rents nowadays. So we have huge problems that we need to deal with. I just wanted to point that out in this debate, but I think that this housing implementation plan and that's not to say we can't do anything about this reassessment problem outside of this housing implementation plan and I’m hoping to hear from…we have a contest coming up for Mayor, I’d like to hear some ideas on how we solve these problems because really it is an issue. But overall, I don't understand why Mr. Sanders is criticizing the housing policy. Yeah, it would be nice to throw millions of more dollars into our housing problem. There are some incremental financing ideas here I think are very important. We're using that fund. We’re looking at ways of replenishing that fund so that we can spend more money on revitalizing neighbourhoods so that people at least have a decent place to live in and how we get to what's affordable, I think, is very important, very difficult, but overall I think that we need to thank our City housing policy people who come up with this implementation plan, I think it is overall, it’s setting the right direction to go. Yes, it could be better, but it's definitely taking us in a direction where we can solve these problems. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will be voting in support of this implementation plan.</P>
<P class="p73 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p31 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you. Of course, I’m rising in support of the adoption of this plan. I’d like to thank the Mayor who appointed me to chair the Housing Steering Committee a couple of years ago. Councillors Pagtakhan and Vandal were members of the committee and we were tasked with the updating our housing policy which Council adopted in September last year and this is the implementation plan from that updated policy. I want to make a couple of comments because of things that were said earlier about the consultation process. I wanted to make them anyway because it's frustrating when you do something good and it's a bit misrepresented because of obviously no consultation process is perfect, but I wanted to say that there were some extraordinary efforts made by our committee and by our staff to work</P>

<P class="p26 ft6">in collaboration with the significant community we have in Winnipeg of housing stakeholders, including levels of government, community groups, organizations that are involved <NOBR>in-housing.</NOBR> And, a company was hired and it was mentioned that there was nobody at a meeting, but there wasn't just one meeting, there was the…you know, we went back and got further information of those other meetings. There was a number of one on one meetings and all different kind of meetings to get significant inclusion and collaboration and we had submissions from many, many groups. We had over 20 people in attendance. We’ve had people in attendance at many meetings, but we had over 20 representatives of many of these organizations just to even up the last meeting just to approve the implementation policy that they had had several weeks to review. The agenda was made public several weeks ahead. So for those who are critical of our accountability and transparency that we’d seen in the…at this Council. There was a significant effort made to do better in this case, so I hope people do appreciate that and I think that the community and the housing community that were involved in this process really appreciated it and they are supportive of it. And I don’t agree that they’re only supportive of…for that reason. They’re very supportive of this big step forward. So to speak to the plan, housing is a field we tackled together. We can't do it alone, so these partnerships and collaborations are obviously crucial. There were 60 issues that the Housing Policy spoke to, supporting implementation of our City plan obviously, encouraging development and retention of more affordable housing and…at rental, which wasn't addressed in our previous plan, addressed the needs of a population in core housing needs, neighbour revitalization, support for revitalization in the areas of most need, an increased options to fund and support desired housing activity. On that point, one of the issues was budget and whether there is enough money here. There’s never enough money for the things we want to do, but some of the tools and implementation strategies that will be looked at and brought back to Council could bring more investment back to neighbourhood revitalization and those funds that support that. So there are things in here that could really improve what we’ve been able to do. The three goals for the next five years that are outlined in the implementation plan are targetted development to achieve healthy rental vacancy rate. That three percent number wasn’t just pulled out of nowhere. It came from the FCM numbers from the CMHC numbers that, that’s a target that cities across the country are striving for. So up to that level of three percent, it makes sense to have incentives in this proposal in front of you. So in…we’re trying to achieve with this, a healthy rental vacancy rate, revitalization of neighbourhoods and reducing homelessness through the delivery of the homelessness partnering strategy for the Government of Canada, something we’ve been working very closely with all of those players in developing this plan. It's a road map that links that clauses in the Housing Policy to support these goals. Investing…I also want to make the comment that investing in neighbourhood revitalization is a sensible economic choice and investment as well as a sensible social investment. This is about investing in our neighbourhoods, investing in our city in a way that pays us back, not just economically, but it does in terms of the tax base and stability and the health of our communities, but also in the social health of people on dealing with some of the challenges we face, improving the quality of life of people so they have a place to live. These problems are real. Affordable rental accommodation is very difficult to come by and that's because of a number of factors. We…how many young people or older adults for that matter are struggling to live independently? There’s a shortage of affordable housing of all kinds including rental with the housing market, with renovations and the loss of older housing stock on older rental accommodation and various issues. Yesterday, the ten year plan to address homelessness was announced at the United Way press conference. This has been many years in the making and we are…that exercises to bring in the whole community including the business community and philanthropist and the <NOBR>non-profit</NOBR> sector and all levels of government to try to tackle these problems which is what has been done successfully in other centres like Edmonton and Calgary and other places in Canada, Vancouver, working on these issues which we clearly face in Winnipeg. So homelessness is an issue that must be addressed comprehensively and the City has a role to play by showing leadership and support as part of the team working together with the other levels of government. The plan in front of you has clear goals that will focus efforts and <NOBR>co-ordinate</NOBR> to improve the rental market and facilitates more affordability providing return on investment through neighbourhood revitalization and reducing homelessness. Specific programs I want to point out that would be designed if we are to use some of the tools that are identified in here. Tax increment financing tools like we’ve used in the past with the downtown incentive programs and others will come back to Council for approval for the details. So in that sense, all the details aren't here, but it lays out a variety of tools that will come back to Council if we take that direction to, which we should I believe to implement what's in this plan. But I think it's important to have a clear outlining of the steps related to our goals that Council can take leadership on and follow and that is the work that as Chair of the committee I’ve been trying to do, is bring forward a plan along with our staff and doing an incredible job and I want to thank them. And with the community, that will address these goals and when this started I said to EPC, when I went before the Mayor when I was tasked with this, and I said there’s three main problems in the city, affordable rental accommodation, affordable housing, neighbourhoods that need, will continue to need, revitalization that continues to be a need and addressing the issues of homelessness. And I’m pleased that those are the three key goals of this plan. If there is anybody who still thinks we can ignore those problems, you know, I think you’re mistaken. I think we can all stand behind this to, for this to be effective, it’s going to take leadership from us now to move ahead and adopt all of these tools as possibilities and then obviously there will be, over the next number of years that we can implement this with the leadership that our citizens choose in October. So I hope that people see this as, you know, nothing is perfect. It's easy to come and criticize, it’s easy to be pessimistic I guess about what we can do in a problem as difficult as housing, which is very challenging.</P>

You know, people are…there are some discouraging, it’s hard to have the perfect plan in front of us, but I really think if you look at this carefully, there are some excellent tools here, there’s some excellent work here, there’s a huge potential if this Council shows the leadership to pick up those tools to support our staff, to support the partnerships we have with…built with the community, we can really make a difference in Winnipeg and we’ve seen it in other cities that they’ve taken these kinds of plans and done that. I mean I think Winnipeg was a leader in bringing our plan forward in 2000 and this builds on that, this expands that, it adopts to the current situation. When the plan first started, we weren’t really focused on the shortage of rental accommodation. No one wanted to talk about that. Now we're talking about that, and we’re trying to address that.

I congratulate some of my…I want to congratulate my colleagues, Councillor Vandal and our Chairperson, Councillor Jenny Gerbasi for the wonderful work she’s done in terms of spearheading this housing implementation policy. I just want to say that, you know, the City of Winnipeg really has a proud history of being a partner, a very strong community partner, when it comes to housing and affordable housing development, Madam Speaker, within our city. We’ve had a housing policy since 1999 in our history and in the last couple of years, we’ve worked really hard to make sure that we now have a new policy which was voted on by this Council in September of 2013. Here now, we see the housing…the housing, the Winnipeg Housing Policy Implementation Plan and I think it's a great plan. It’s got the backing of a wide variety of stakeholders within our communities and it really is a testimony to the great partnerships that have been occurring between all three levels of government, the Federal, the Provincial, our Municipal government here as well as the all the bureaucrats and all those levels of government as well as the community at large. You know, Madam Speaker, I just want to say there’s been a lot of great projects in the last few years and I can fondly remember a lot of them in the last few, Welcome Place on Bannatyne Avenue, that is about 27 units for newcomers. We have Flora Place, our delegation Mr. David Sanders was instrumental in helping make, sorry…realize at Florence and Clare. We have the living gospel family place, Madam Speaker, on William Avenue, just across from the <NOBR>7-Eleven</NOBR> there at Isabel and William, and the Peace Tower, one in Chinatown right across on Princess and Logan. As well, Madam Speaker, you know, we’ve done some affordable housing outside of the inner city. We’ve done one recently with Winnipeg Housing Rehabilitation Corporation in Transcona, named after one of Transcona’s greatest members, only second of course Councillor Russ Wyatt, Mr. Paul E Martin, a former elected official within Transcona. And you know, we continue to do great work, Madam Speaker, within Point Douglas within North Point Douglas within William Whyte, with the Centennial neighbourhood, the West End, but they’re…and West Broadway. But you know, Madam Speaker, the challenge is still there. Can we do more? Can the City of Winnipeg do more? Absolutely. And, you know, that's a challenge moving forward. This is a great start and I hope that we can build upon that and looking forward to the Mayor’s closing remarks and perhaps the challenges out there that we can continue to do more. The community is asking for greater capacity and because there’s certainly lots of work to be done. Thanks so much, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p68 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mr. Mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p46 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think the first thing I’d like to say is that when it came to the Winnipeg Housing Steering Committee, a previous Chair had been Councillor Pagtakhan who I think did a very good job and it was time to make a change trying to find someone he knew would be very passionate and committed as well. I don't think you could’ve found anybody more passionate or more committed than Councillor Gerbasi. And I’m going to use Councillor Gerbasi's line. “It's unfortunate when you do something good and it is misrepresented”. I think at some point in time, we’ve all, probably all had that feeling. But what I’d like to say right now is I want to thank Councillor Gerbasi and Councillor Pagtakhan and Councillor Vandal for the job they did. I also want to thank the administration who worked very hard and this motion should be passed unanimously, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Mayor. All those in favour of Item 1? Contrary carried? It is unanimous. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>We’ll now move to question period for the Mayor. Any questions? See lots of hands, Councillor Browaty, Councillor Fielding followed by Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much Madam Speaker. I read this morning that the Mayor was involved in a press conference with the Provincial Minister Responsible for the City of Winnipeg. Would the Mayor be willing to share with us how much money he understands the new PST increase is bringing in and how much of that is being directed to the City of Winnipeg?</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mr. Mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you, I thank the Councillor for the question. I cannot tell you exactly. I don't have access to the information about how much money the PST is bringing in, but I can tell you that as a result of it bringing in more money, the Province has topped off their contribution from the previous year by a total of $7 million. So last year they matched…we were putting up seven million, and now they add another 7 million for $14 million and I believe…actually I know that's over a period of five years.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>At least <NOBR>two-thirds</NOBR> of the Province's population lives within the City of Winnipeg. One point of PST, I believe, brings in something in the neighbourhood of $260 million. If the Province is really spending all this additional money on roads, is $7 million anywhere close to enough?</P>
<P class="p23 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, $7 million is not close enough to solve our problem. Obviously you can do the arithmetic. The realities are this Council and through the Association of Manitoba Municipalities, had lobbied for the one percent of the PST which would give us approximately $249 million which would make a big difference in addressing our</P>

<P class="p96 ft4">infrastructure deficit. As you know, that never happened. In addition to that, I can tell you that I still have ongoing conversations with the Provincial Government to basically refund the PST that we pay, similar to the way the Federal Government refunds the GST, which would give us a significant amount of money because this would be a long term commitment and we could leverage that and borrow more money as well. But if the answer is, the 7 million enough to solve our infrastructure problem, the answer is no. I think that might have been a rhetorical question.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Third question?</P>
<P class="p40 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Every service the City buys, every product that the City buys - paper, computers, whatever, we now pay an extra one percent on the dollar for everything we buy. That's a lot of money. Is it in fact probably getting close to $7 million? Is the City really no further ahead when it comes down to it at the end of the day? Projects like the Convention Centre, hundreds of millions of dollars. An extra one point adds up very, very quickly. Is the City any further ahead even with this PST increase? Our City roads…I mean it’s good to see City roads being attended to and I mean, the list of roads being done is more than we were doing when I was first elected at least, and that's a good thing but again, is the Province doing enough and is this really a shell game and the City no further ahead?</P>
<P class="p70 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, the PST that we pay was approximately in the neighbourhood of about $12 million, so if you add on one percent you can do the arithmetic and figure out what that would be. The realities are, is that you can look at it two different ways. You can look at it that when the pledge was made for that first $7 million, it was $7 million more than zero. This time they doubled it so it's gone to $14 million, so you decide is the cup half empty or half full.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Yes, a question…(inaudible) in the paper a couple of days ago. There was some talk about the City's appointee to, I guess it was the Bomber board but it’s the BBB Corporation. I tend to agree actually with your position on that. I’m just wondering, has there been any…I guess two questions. Number one, has there been any agreements in place? Did the Bomber board have the authority to, I guess, veto our appointee to it and number two, have there been any developments since their last discussion?</P>
<P class="p97 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to Councillor Fielding I thank you for the question. Number one, I am still officially waiting. It was my understanding there was supposed to be a board meeting yesterday to deal with this issue and I have yet to be notified what the outcome was. There was a board meeting that was supposed to take place in early March but that was cancelled. That’s number one. Number two, all I can tell the Councillor through you is that the City and the Province have always appointed someone to the Winnipeg Football Club Board. There have been private citizens appointed by both the Province and the City in the past. There has never been a situation, to my knowledge, where it wasn't automatically accepted.</P>
<P class="p15 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p28 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. The project manager who oversaw the construction of the Investor Group Field Stadium happens to be the same project manager who oversaw the police headquarters up until an abrupt contract not being renewed at December 31, 2013, and I believe this is the same project manager that is or was overseeing the Convention Centre expansion. Given the development of the leaks at the stadium, can the Mayor confirm whether he has been told of any leaks of water or other substances at the police headquarters and what confidence can he reassure us or provide us that problems won't be encountered at the police headquarters?</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to the Councillor, number one, as anybody who has the opportunity to watch, listen or read the media, I think you are well aware of the fact that contrary to what my opinion was, no one has been allowed to see any of those damages so it would be very difficult to comment on something you have never been able to see. Neither yours truly or any member of the media was allowed to view it. Those are the facts so it's difficult to make a comment on something you have never seen.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Anything further Councillor?</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I don't believe my question was answered. If the Mayor was referring to the Winnipeg Stadium, I wasn't asking about that. I was asking about the police headquarters and I have concerns that the same project manager has overseen a significant part of the construction of the police headquarters. So, can the Mayor comment on the police headquarters aspect of what the project manager had overseen?</P>

<P class="p98 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, it's my understanding that, I believe, sometime next week, all of Council will be invited to tour the building. Maybe that would be the appropriate time to ask the question of the people who are building it. I certainly intend to be there and hope other members of Council will be there as well.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Third question Councillor Havixbeck?</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I guess I feel that wasn't the answer but, what is the status of the hiring of the CAO, please?</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I can update you, because we just had a little meeting yesterday as a matter of fact, our committee of nine. We have had several applications; I think well over 80. I believe there is a short list that's come forward and we will be having a meeting next week to determine on how to move forward.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p40 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Mr. Mayor. To the Mayor through you Madam Speaker. Just wanted to get some clarity on the infrastructure monies that were being talked about by Councillor Browaty. I'm not sure exactly what 7 million that he was referring to but as I understand it, each year since the increase in the PST, last year being a part year and this year being a full year, the Province gives us some additional money on top of the one percent which represents the growth in the PST. I think that amount this year was about $9 million. I wonder if the Mayor can confirm that when we’re talking about $9 million of PST, we are in fact talking about the growth that that one percent gains each year within the City of Winnipeg, or 7 million as it might have been last year.</P>
<P class="p99 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>To try and qualify, I believe last year when Council took the move to basically address our infrastructure and local roads, back lanes, sidewalks, et cetera, which was basically led by Councillor Wyatt, through that one percent, when that was approved here, later on in our budget year the Province came forward with an additional $7 million. This year, if my memory serves me well, I believe they added on another $7 million so the total is 14. I am happy to look into that number of $9 million but that's my recollection of the chart that I recall reviewing Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p20 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p40 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Mayor. Perhaps you could also confirm maybe through the Speaker that a lot of the monies collected within the City of Winnipeg are being utilized for projects outside the City of Winnipeg that we all benefit from, whether it's major highways. I know there’s been talk about the Trans Canada Highway. There’s some of the economic corridors that we are looking at doing, Highway 75 in particular, straight south. That is of great benefit to the City of Winnipeg and when we’re calculating what we’re spending money on, whether it's Provincial or City, that we need to, when we’re looking at those public…or Provincial sales tax dollars, that we need to calculate some of that outside of the Winnipeg…outside of the City of Winnipeg construction that we all benefit from and factor that in as well.</P>
<P class="p37 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I believe all of us have had the opportunity to see many of the announcements that have been made by the Provincial Government on infrastructure and what the Councillor has referred to is absolutely correct. They have made announcements regarding highways outside the city. There’s no question about it and there’s no question that I’m sure we all travel those at the same time, so there have been commitments made to improve and rebuild and enhance those highways. That's a fact.</P>
<P class="p68 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Smith? Councillor Smith, you have the floor.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Mr. Mayor, you know, you mentioned that we were going to be touring the new police headquarters, but what are we doing with the old police service centre? What are your plans for it?</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I think what the Councillor meant is, what are our plans for it, but I’ll just assume that for the time being. I can tell you that our department has been thoroughly going through that scenario. As everyone knows, there are different options that are available. You know, the option is that first of all, we know that building would either stay there or be demolished. That's a decision that Council will have to make. If it stays there we’ll decide what departments we can move in there to have what we call a campus type environment. The realities are going back from the parkade all the way to the back, that's an opportunity for development, which would be put out there to the marketplace and approved by this Council. I can tell Councillor Smith, through you, that I believe within the month we should have a report coming forward here and so Councillor Smith should be able to see that.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Anything further? Councillor Fielding.</P>

<P class="p96 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>One question Mr. Mayor. There was lots of discussions over the last few months about an ethics…whether it be a commissioner or what have you. I think where we left off was that there was some talk that there needs to be agreement from the Province. I’m wondering if you could update us on that. I think you had committed to putting it in the budget process.</P>
<P class="p17 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you I thank Councillor Fielding for that question. If many of you recall, we had this discussion. We also got a written legal opinion that we needed the Province to make some changes. I know that other members of Council had some discussion with the Province. It's my understanding that the Provincial Government still feels the same way, that they believe that this Council has the authority to do what is required. Our Clerk's office, as well as our legal opinion didn't necessarily agree with that, and that's where we are right now and I believe I saw something to that effect within the last week.</P>
<P class="p68 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>One further on kind of a different topic. The real estate audit is coming forward. I know obviously that's controlled somewhat by the auditor but is there a Council seminar that’s scheduled? Is there a time line that you have in place in terms of the real estate audit?</P>
<P class="p40 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I can tell you that the real estate audit is not somewhat controlled by the auditor. It is 100 percent controlled by the auditor. I can also tell you that I have heard it should be coming in the very near future, which by my definition is May. I’ve heard nothing more than that, and when that happens there would most definitely be a Council seminar. That would certainly be my request, yes.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Anything further? Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Can the Mayor tell us the status of the other audits, such as the legal opinion, the second and third parts of the fire paramedic audit and as well the police audit. I understand the service provider was just awarded a contract within the last couple of weeks. Will that be on schedule to be delivered to the City in the time frame specified by Council?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>First of all I’ll go backwards. Number one, someone has been appointed, a provider to do that. As everybody here knows, Council gave a very direct and definitive goal just to get it done by such and such a time and we’ve heard nothing other than that was still the goal. That's number one. As far as the legal opinion, it's my understanding that that should be coming very shortly. That's really all I know as far as those two items are concerned.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. I’d like to go back to a question that was not answered sufficiently to me. Can the Mayor confirm whether he has been told of any leaks of water or other substances at the police headquarters?</P>
<P class="p40 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Definitive no, Madam Speaker. I have not been told of anything of that ilk, thank you, and if the Councillor has I would appreciate her sharing it with all of us right now.</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Okay. Councillor Orlikow, you have the floor.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Mr. Mayor, I’m not sure if you are aware later on if you tell me. The reduced speed zones for schools. Can you tell us…I know September is coming around. Can you tell us where we’re at with that?</P>
<P class="p100 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I thank Councillor Orlikow for that question. I'll speak for yours truly, extremely disappointed in how that whole process went. We…our goal…and I’m sure everybody remembers…was to have all that done by this past September. Unfortunately, the Province came back with some regulations and rules such as you couldn't have it…it has to be such and such a distance from the intersection. The signs had to be of such size which means the holes that we were digging would not carry the signs we were putting up. So it hasn't happened which I think is extremely unfortunate. Our goal is to get that done for September, and I can tell Councillor Orlikow that I did ask the department to give me an update on where that's at and as soon as I get that I will be more than happy to share that with him as well.</P>
<P class="p99 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Any more questions for the Mayor? No? I guess that ends question period. There’s just I believe Councillor, there are two sets of questions per member. He’s asked two sets of questions, so that would end question period. Okay. Next, we will move on to the Committee on Protection and Community Services. Councillor Mayes.</P>

<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker, pleased to move the report dated April 14th, 2014, Items 1 through 4 inclusive.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>All those in favour? Councillor Vandal. All those in favour of two to four? Contrary? Carried, Madam Clerk.</P>
<P class="p103 ft1">Item 1 - Current Enforcement Procedures – Hazardous Materials</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal has been a champion of this item. So pleased to hear his comments or questions.</P>
<P class="p104 ft15"><SPAN class="ft16">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, my congratulations first of all to the Chairperson for shepherding this forward. I think this is a very positive initiative. It’s a step in the right direction, but I’m not prepared to say that this the best that we can achieve. And it's important for everyone to understand that this originated with the Speedway International fire, Madam Speaker, and I need to say that I am very, very relieved as we all are that nobody died in that fire. It's something that I hope never happens again and I think that our response to this has been a little long. This is a unique area of the city because it has a high number of high hazard sites in the area and if you read the report, Madam Speaker, and there’s a lot in the report, I believe there’s about 250 sites identified as high hazard all over the city, but a high majority of them are in this Mission Industrial Area. They’re also zoned M3 which is a Mission Industrial Area where there’s a lot of M3 zoning. In this area as well, Madam Speaker, there are at least 16 sites with environmental licences by the Province of Manitoba and that's very significant, Madam Speaker, because that means there’s dangerous materials on site. That’s also significant because the Province of Manitoba is on record as saying that they have no role in the inspections of these sites with environmental licences and I need to say Speedway International does have an or did have an environmental licence at the time of the incredible fire. So Madam Speaker, I need to put that on the record. The province has said there was no role in inspections. And in my…my estimation, Madam Speaker, when you hand out an environmental licence to an industry, and in the case of Speedway International, you hand out a grant of one million dollars to ensure that that business is encouraged and proliferates at the site, then by nature of that, you have a role in the inspections, Madam Speaker, and I know there is a process in place that the Province is embarking on, where they’re looking at perhaps enlarging the areas where they have mandated inspections, but it's taking far too long and I think there’s a role for other levels of government in high hazard areas. So that's the point I want to make on that. I think the City has come to the table. We're doing what we need to do. We're hiring staff. We're increasing costs for those inspections. And we're going to do an annual inspection of high hazard areas, but there’s a role for the Province and there is a role for the Federal Government as well. And because there’s a rail line very close to this area where I’m told and I’m not sure it's conclusive, where there were hazardous materials stored on the rail line. So there, there definitely is a role for all levels of government to ensure public safety. It's not only the purview and the responsibility of the City of Winnipeg, it's the responsibility of all governments, Madam Speaker. But I think in the long term, what we need to do is put distance between where those high hazard areas are and where people are living, and that's a complicated thing to do, Madam Speaker, because the reality is many of those high hazard industrial sites have been there before the homes are there and there is such a thing called as nonconforming rights where they have private property rights, they have zoning rights and it’s very, very difficult to move an existing high hazard area that, frankly, has been there before the residences were there. So we need a plan in the long term, a plan that's visionary, a plan that when there is investment in new industrial areas puts as much distance as possible between existing homes and high hazard industrial areas, Madam Speaker, and we are working…I met with the acting CAO this week with the Property staff. We are working on a secondary plan for the Mission Industrial Area. I know there’s opportunities for infrastructure transportation improvements at Marion and Archibald. That’s in the works. There’s consultations with the community and I think in the long term that secondary plan is going to be so very important to put that distance between the residences and where the high hazards are. So, I don't want to leave the impression I’m not…I’m not in favour of this report. I think it's very positive. I commend Councillor Mayes for…and Councillor Browaty because it was reported at the Property Committee a few months ago. I commend their commitment to stick handle this through the process and certainly it's very positive. It’s a step in the right direction, but I think we always need to be vigilant and we always need to be doing more to protect our constituents safety. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p73 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p105 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>I just want to thank Councillor Vandal for standing this report down and to speak to it as well because I think it's a real concern and issue after that fire that we had. The reality is this is improving the level of inspections that the City of Winnipeg undertakes; however, there is still a huge need as Councillor Vandal pointed out for the Department of Conservation, the Province of Manitoba to improve their process. I know of industries that have not been inspected</P>

<P class="p106 ft6">who have environmental licences; who’ve not been inspected for decades by provincial conservation officers and yet they, some…I know one industry that gets an annual visit from Homeland Security of the United States because of what they manufacture. And I can tell you that if Homeland Security is checking out one of our Department of Conservation should be doing that at least annually. And this is a firm with a very high corporate…good corporate track record by the way, and so you know, and we rely on that and we rely on that good will, but I think it's important to have the regulation…regulatory framework in place for high hazard facilities. If anybody wants to see what can go wrong or what can happen just in the last two years, feel free to google West Texas as in <NOBR>west-east,</NOBR> west Texas and you can see what happens when a fire erupts at a…in this case, it was a fertilizer plant which we have in the city and started…the fire started and then the explosion occurred and 12 people died including the volunteer firefighters and a whole apartment block that was taken down. It was almost like a mini, small nuclear explosion. You know, if things go wrong, they can really go wrong. And so we have to plan for the worst, we also have to recognize that we live in a modern industrial society; that we’ve invented over half a million new chemicals and compounds since World War II. We rely on all these goods and services and we inspect them in terms of a modern society and we need to manufacture them. They’re manufactured typically in urban areas, around urban areas, so how best do you do that? How best do you manage that? Clearly, it's an area where the Province has, I think, you know, not done enough to address the concerns in terms of hazardous materials and we need to call on them to improve that. The fact that we're going to now undertake annual inspections is a huge improvement of the high hazard industries. There is still a concern that a lot of these industries now are locating, Madam Speaker, on the edge of our city with not full level of municipal services. This motion, of course, doesn't speak to that because that's not inside of the City of Winnipeg and there are volunteer fire departments out there as well and there’s a real concern that I have in terms of those industries that are…but these are plans, these are municipal plans quite often approved by the municipality then approved by the Provincial Government to allow industrial development on literally on the edge of our city and in some cases the zoning requirement is a lot, as we all know, a lot more lax in the RMs, they are inside the city, and in fact, they don't even have that separate designations in a lot of cases. Industrial’s just industrial. It could be anything from light to maximum. The other thing that we don't have in the City of Winnipeg that this report doesn't touch on and it would be somewhat of a challenge to probably bring forward, but nevertheless it's definitely a policy piece that should be discussed and that is hazardous material routes. All our trucking routes today in the City of Winnipeg technically are for all intents and purposes, hazardous material routes because we don't have hazardous material routes inside, through the City of Winnipeg, so that basically means every truck route is a hazardous materials route. And of course, we have the issue of trains, and I want to thank the Federal Government for pushing the railways to slow down; however we still have that issue and I want to thank, and there’s a motion that’s been referred in terms of train routes and trains that are hauling more goods and services than they ever did before in terms of hazardous material right through the heart of the city. So, ideally, I know FCM is pushing hard to try to…an initiative to try to, in light of what's happening with the railways to see if there is a program to build and get railways out of our cities and around the cities and in terms of the benefits and savings there, in terms of cost with regards to grade separations and safety issues and hazards that are directly related to that are huge and growing because of the challenges that we're facing now and what they are hauling. So, there’s a number of issues. This is one first step, but there’s still a number of issues with regards to this as I have pointed out. Thanks.</P>
<P class="p107 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Mayes to close.</P>
<P class="p105 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I don't want to get too much into…it's sort of interesting we had the Province denounced for <NOBR>over-regulating</NOBR> on the school signs and now the Province is denounced for <NOBR>under-regulating</NOBR> on hazardous materials. I don't really want to get into all of that. We did have some new legislation proposed here the other day, on the Day of Mourning, to increase coverage for workers who are injured, so I think the Province is moving forward on that which has some bearing on hazardous materials. But, there is a debate here to be had about the role of the province, certainly a big debate to be had about the role of the Federal Government on railway safety. I noted Councillor Vandal has a motion I think, Councillor Swandel has a motion in…that’s to be discussed about railway safety in possible railway realignment, relocation, I think that's a very important issue for the future of the city. So I’m not going to get into a whole a lot of Province/Federal issues here. I think…I think I was on the media when this first came out saying it’s a good first step English while Councillor Vandal was saying it’s a good first step en fran<SPAN class="ft22">ҫ</SPAN>ais with Radio Canada. So I think we're both of the same mind, it is a good first step. We’re moving forward on this, and I would like to take the chance and I’m pleased to have this chance to commend Bill Clark, the now former Acting Chief who has retired recently whose name is on this report who has retired. We are…I think we were lucky to have Mr. Clark acting as our Acting Chief for a period of time and I know he put a lot of work into this. It was delayed a couple of times I think trying to get it right, trying to get the costing right, trying to get the ideas right on how to proceed. I know he was proud of this and was moving it forward. So I want to wish him a happy retirement. We now have the new Chief, Chief Lane is in place, paramedic experience, fire experience, we’re excited to have him and look forward to moving into the future. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p98 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. All those in favour of Item one? Contrary? Carried. We have one motion, Motion No. 2. from Councillor Pagtakhan and Councillor Mayes regarding the feasibility study for Billy Mosienko Arena. This will be an automatic referral to Protection and Community Services.</P>

<P class="p95 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>We’ll now move on to question period. Any questions for the Chair? Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal. </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker, through you to Councillor Mayes, Dalnavert Museum has been in the news a lot lately, and I know that there are tens of thousands of museum dollars still tied up with Dalnavert Museum in 2014, so my question to the Chairperson of Protection and Community Services is: what is the plan and is there a deadline to actually make a decision on the future of Dalnavert and if not, can the Museums Board <NOBR>re-allocate</NOBR> the existing museum dollars for the museum?</P>
<P class="p110 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Yeah, I want to thank the Councillor for the question. That is a timely question and it’s been the subject of some debate amongst different Councillors and with our Museums Board and with the public. Certainly Philippe Mailhot, who is the head of St. Boniface Museum, I think called Councillor Vandal and myself the day the first report appeared about Candace House possibly moving into the Museum, because the St. Boniface Museum is certainly in need of some funding to make up for reductions. Last year, I know, Councillor Vandal and myself, and I think Councillor Swandel, provided them some money. We just don’t have it this year, so St. Boniface Museum is looking at some funding reductions. So are some of our other museums. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with the following situation: Dalnavert normally gets a grant of $19,950 from the City of Winnipeg, so let’s call it $20,000, so there are tens of thousands of dollars tied up. I’ve had people calling me up critical saying, “Well they’ve been closed since Labour Day. You should have cut some of their funding from last year, not just this year. <NOBR>Re-allocate.”</NOBR> I have people calling up saying the complete reverse of that which is, “There’s no way you should <NOBR>re-allocate,</NOBR> keep the funding, something might yet come of this. Don’t give the money away because then they might come back and ask for more.” I think that’s a debate that we probably need to have as Council as a whole. The Museums Board met yesterday. I haven’t yet got their report but they’re very much, I think, concerned with the issues. So the process needs a deadline. I would suggest June 30 might be as good a deadline as anything else. I know Councillor Gerbasi has expressed her concerns about doing anything in a rushed or rash manner many times. Dalnavert is in her ward and she’s been a champion of that, so I think there are a number of viewpoints here. Candace House proposal is now in the mix. I know Councillor Gerbasi has been a champion of carrying on and trying to make sure it stays on as a museum. On the other hand we’re getting calls from some of the other museums saying if they’re not going to use the money, we sure could use that money. What to do with the 20,000…my own personal view is to let the Museums Board <NOBR>re-allocate</NOBR> it. Others may have different view. I welcome the councillor bringing a motion on this. We should have a debate about it. We should make a decision because otherwise we may end up going a whole year with $20,000 sitting in our bank account while other museums are <NOBR>down-staffing</NOBR> because they don’t have the funds, so it’s a fair question. I do think this needs a deadline and I welcome the councillor if he has a date proposed to bring that forward to the committee and I think we’re going to have to try and encourage the Historical Society and Friends of Dalnavert to give us some answers here in the relatively new future.</P>
<P class="p111 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further questions for the Chair? Okay, we will move on to the Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works. Councillor Swandel, on the report dated April 17, 2014.</P>

<P class="p95 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yes Madam Chairman. I’d like to ask the Chair of the Committee what they’re going to be doing, what the department is going to be doing, with St. James Street. As you know, two years in a row it’s been judged, and this year it’s been judged by over 500 people, as the worst street in Winnipeg. Can you tell me what your department is planning on doing about it?</P>
<P class="p115 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>That’s not my department, that’s our department, that’s the City’s department. Let me start by saying I appreciate the question. You know, the CAA does this poll every year and “pick your worst street” street. It’s really great to get the information but it would be even better if we could get it put in context. Seven out of the top ten streets were actually included in this year’s budget for renewal and I believe with respect to St. James Street, as the good Councillor knows, it’s already included in the context of the Polo Park area. So I think all ten of the streets in some way, shape or form that were raised through that poll, we’re addressing the issues, so it’s not unusual that they would pop up as the top ten streets, so the direct answer to the question is yes it is being considered and work will be done on it. We’re doing some other work on some streets in there. Some of it is a bit of patch work until we can get to the bigger picture plan. You know we describe that often as <NOBR>“throw-away</NOBR> money”. We don’t want to be using <NOBR>throw-away</NOBR> money and I would suggest that maybe the next time CAA wants to do a poll, they can do it on the access to their services during the coldest times of our year which seem to be running to extremely long lengths this year. I think some people were waiting up to days to get the services that we all pay so dearly for, so we do appreciate the information but would be much better if it was put in context and hopefully that gives some context to the good Councillor on St. James Street as well.</P>

<P class="p95 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Through you to the Chair, I’d like to ask a question regarding mobile signs. In 2007, I believe it was, when we passed the new zoning <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> <NOBR>By-law</NOBR> 200/2006, we had a clause in there</P>

<P class="p59 ft4">about mobile signs, and some of the Councillors will recall that we had developed a licensing, or an approval process that included a payment of a fee that was to go towards enforcement. One of the conditions in the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> was that over a short period of time, the signs were to become black on white or white on black. To date, I continue to see these mobile signs with the wondrous <NOBR>day-glow</NOBR> colours that folks come up with, and there are numerous terms that have been used. The one I prefer is the visual pollutant affecting our city. Given that we’ve been collecting all the money that was supposed to go towards enforcing…, I wonder if the Chair can just give us some feedback and maybe update us on what we’re doing for enforcement and why these signs continue to proliferate throughout the city.</P>
<P class="p99 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Through you to the Councillor, I actually just recently had some conversations with our staff in regards to mobile signs and EMCs and you know, means for various businesses to promote their changing messages. That last <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that the Councillor is referring to in terms of mobile signs drastically reduced the amount of times that businesses can have mobile signs up. The number of mobile signs throughout our neighbourhoods has decreased substantially over time. In regards to the enforcement issues, I will follow up with the department to see what’s being done or not being done on that matter. Again we also have new rules and regulations on EMCs and some of the enforcement issues on that. I do understand that people with the signs that have licences for those signs have been communicated with. The rules regarding motion being restricted outside the downtown area do need to be enforced as well as the amount of brightness that’s being put off by the signs. Again, probably that enforcement will all be tied up together and there is a person that has been hired and that process is just starting, so it would probably make sense that the <NOBR>by-laws</NOBR> are very similar and that they would be enforced together.</P>
<P class="p126 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question Councillor?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Just, I guess, are you aware that many of the newer zonings in our city, or <NOBR>re-zonings</NOBR> in our city, there’s a restriction on the mobile signs not being permitted and that it’s a different form of enforcement than just going out and looking at the license and whether or not they’re actually meeting the criteria. So we also need to look at it from a zoning perspective which I think is a little more difficult than…because you have to look at each property to see what their zoning criteria is, so if the Councillor is aware of that I’d like to know.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Through you to the Councillor, I certainly am now.</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further questions for the Chair? Okay, Councillor Steen moves that we adjourn. Those of you that are attending the Heritage Winnipeg luncheon, enjoy yourselves. No <NOBR>by-laws.</NOBR> That was done already. Roll call, Madam Clerk.</P>
