<P class="p20 ft2">who do it are not in it for the recognition. However, we believe that these special people should be recognized. Today, I'm asking all citizens to help us acknowledge these people who give so much of themselves. I encourage everyone to think about the people who work selflessly for the betterment of others and please submit a nomination. The deadline for nominations is March the 16th. More information and a nomination form can be found at Winnipeg.ca or from my office. Thank you very much.</P>
<P class="p21 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Mayor Katz. We have two delegations today with us. We would like to invite Lorrie Rogalka from Garden City Community Centre to speak, please. Lorrie. You have ten minutes.</P>
<P class="p22 ft1">DELEGATIONS</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Lorrie Rogalka: </SPAN>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Mayor Katz, Members of Council, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Lorrie Rogalka and I’m the treasurer of Garden City Community Centre; I’m also a member of the Seven Oaks Arena Project Committee.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6">Myself, along with the entire Garden City Community Centre Board and the Seven Oaks Project Committee are very excited to be able to finally share our vision with everyone for a new twin indoor arena at the Garden City Community Centre. The addition of the two indoor rinks, along with much needed programming space, will complement the existing amenities at Garden City, which include our club house, gymnasium, outdoor basketball courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds and indoor Soccerplex and make our centre a true multiplex. The benefits of this multiplex centre will be far reaching and will include not only the Garden City Community Centre but also the entire Seven Oaks area. Sorry. Along with... Last year we amalgamated with the Northwest Winnipeg Hockey Association too, so we have all those areas, as well.</P>
<P class="p24 ft6">To give you a little bit of history, the project actually began back in 2009 by a group of local hockey moms, myself included, who saw the need for indoor hockey ice and we've needed to do something about it. As our efforts move forward and the project grew, additional members joined our group and we now have a committed group of volunteers out of our community that have worked effortlessly and hundreds of hours; and we like to call ourselves the SOAP Committee, as you can tell. Our vision has always been more than just an indoor arena. We want to create a place where families and community members can meet and join together in a variety of activities, where everyone can feel a true sense of community. We would like to thank the members of the Community Service Department, our area Councillor, Devi Sharma and Mayor Katz for his guidance for all their help in bringing our vision forward. So that on behalf of the Garden City Centre and the SOAP committee, I can ask for support your today of our project and our vision. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second delegation, Mr. Bruce Talling on behalf of the East End Community Centre in support of Item Number 8. Bruce? Okay he is coming from the far side there. Good morning. You have 10 minutes.</P>
<P class="p26 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Bruce Talling: </SPAN>Good morning, Mr. Mayor, City Council. My name is Bruce Talling. I am the current President of the East End Community Centre. We are very excited about this project. Our original community club is a very small dressing room and small outdated canteen with very limited storage space. This expansion will allow us to incorporate large dressing rooms, updated washrooms, showers, increase our storage space, a pro shop, modern canteen, provide an updated community centre which will benefit all users. This expansion will allow us to move space – to more space to host other community programs extended in our existing non – that <NOBR>non-ice</NOBR> activities can happen. Community will now be able to host larger tournaments and compete with other centres having 3 sheets of ice under one roof. Expansions – expansion is very <NOBR>–very</NOBR> positive for our community and will bring us to the future for many years to come. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Bruce. Any questions? Seeing none. Alright, that concludes our delegations. We appreciate them coming to speak to us. I guess we'll go right into Executive Policy Committee report of February 6th. Mayor Katz.</P>

<P class="p30 ft1">REPORT OF THE</P>
<P class="p31 ft1">EXECUTIVE POLICY COMMITTEE</P>
<P class="p32 ft1">DATED FEBRUARY 6, 2013</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to introduce the report and move adoption of consent agenda Items 1 to 9.</P>

<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Stand down 9. All right, seeing no other stand downs, we'll vote on 1 through 8. All those in favour? Opposed? Carried.</P>
<P class="p35 ft1">Item 9 – Settlement of Deacons Corner Invoice between Manitoba Hydro and the City of Winnipeg</P>
<P class="p36 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I would love to hear Councillor Swandel's comments, questions and I would be happy to address them.</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p26 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you. I need little bit further clarification on this. As I read through this, it sounds like the City is agreeing to give $300,000 to Manitoba Hydro as a 50 percent representation of expenses relating to the relocation of some hydro towers with the water – when we built the water treatment plant on Deacons Corner. But when I read the very brief report that's in there, the representation made is that the City believes it's in the right that it shouldn't have to pay this money and it's only paying this money to avoid litigation, and the cost of litigation. $300,000 would go a long way in litigation. I'm not sure why would be – we would be agreeing to pay this amount now. The report doesn't give any indication of what it would cost to fight the case. There is no detail in the report on the cost of arguing. It doesn't… you know, there is specific pieces in here referenced to how the deal was actually done. It doesn't state whether or not there is any other ongoing issues with the sale between Winnipeg Hydro and Manitoba Hydro, if this is the final issue. It doesn't say how long this has been ongoing. If this was done as part of the water treatment plant being built and the issue came up, which I think is about 5 years ago now, this should have been on our table or on our radar here a long time before that. And it also makes reference to including it in – it can be covered in the expenses of the Water Treatment Capital program, which I believe we pretty well wrapped up. So you know, just some concerns as to why we would be agreeing to pay $300,000 when a Statement of Claim hasn't even been filed yet. There is an indication that the Statement of Claim will be filed, but we could still make – we could still negotiate and we could still argue as we’re going through the Statement of Claim process. So I'm unsure of why we are agreeing to pay $300,000 in a situation where our own report says we believe we're in the right and that this easement still existed and that we're not responsible for this money. So, I'll leave it at that. I don't know if there is any way to deal with this today. Time is of the essence but, there is a lot less information here than there is it actual information as to why we would make this decision. Those are my comments.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p39 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I will certainly try to address that issue. First of all, Mr. Speaker, the realities are that this is 50 percent of the cost of this project. The City believed that hydro should pay for it and, of course, as you can appreciate, with all the changes that have taken place between Winnipeg Hydro and Manitoba Hydro, et cetera, et cetera, there now are lawyers on the other side who believe that we should be responsible for all of it. So the facts are, you can go to court and you may win, which is terrific; you may lose and have to pay the full amount plus the legal costs. I think as everybody knows, we have an ongoing relationship with Manitoba hydro on many projects worth much more than this, millions of dollars, and I think the department has come forward saying they've got a case, we've got a case, flip a coin, who could win? This would be a very good way of resolving the issue and moving forward and that's the recommendation of the department.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No other comments on Item 9? All those in favour? Opposed? Carried. Thank you. Alright, EPC Report for February 22nd. Mayor Katz.</P>

<P class="p36 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I will hear from Councillor Swandel and I'll certainly address everything that I can.</P>
<P class="p39 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, just trying to get some clarity here. It seems like every other union or labour organization in Manitoba or throughout the country when the solvency exemptions have come up have been agreeable to do them. I know the cost has been brought down greatly of carrying this in the <NOBR>short-term</NOBR> by using a letter of credit instead of actually addressing the solvency… the solvency gap itself. But, it seems to me that you know, in this world today that our police association should be doing a great deal more work trying to work with us rather than throwing up roadblocks like this. It's frustrating to see this and I know, you know, you can throw a lot of criticism out there, police budgets and you know, we look at some of the costs of policing. Nobody wants to criticize the compensation that police officers get. We know how difficult a job it is. But we certainly want to work together in ensuring that we have the financial resources to properly police our streets and our communities.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">You know there is so much misinformation when it comes to police and police pensions and police salaries. I know when we negotiate every year, there is sort of this comparing to other jurisdictions to other cities but yet we don't compare the cost of living in other cities. It's often been said that the Winnipeg Police Department has one of the finest pension plans of any police force in the country, the Police Association will argue that that's not necessarily the case and we've never really had that sorted out for us and had it put on paper. I'm wondering that given that there is this sort of – I don't know if it's animosity, but there’s this sort of a bit of a breakdown between the Police Association and the City. If it wouldn't be a good time to review the overall pension plan itself and take a look at where we stand as the City of Winnipeg in how we support our police force. Because obviously something is not right here when you consider how every other jurisdiction has been able to get these solvency exemptions. And if we're not compensating or we’re not giving appropriate pension to our police department, then let's take a look at that and let's do it you know as comparative analysis, with other cities across – not just across Canada, but across North America. You know, I think we're at the point where we pretty well have to do this but I think – this is – the fact we're being asked to do this, that we don't have a solvency exemption in place like the other labour organizations, is telling us there is something wrong here. And rather than sort of throwing concepts out there, I’d like to suggest that we try and garner more information. How does our pension plan compare to the rest of the country? Are we on the light side or are we the high side? And let's try and mend this relationship with our police association because this – the fact that we would not get agreement on the solvency exemption where every other organization has been able it do that, it’s sending a signal that there is something wrong. So I’d like as a council – I’d like for us to get a lot more information to ensure that our police are being properly compensated and that their pensions are fair and that we are a shining example for the Country. And this is telling us that we're not a good example. This is telling us there is something wrong. So… and I don't know the detail of it, it's not a file I've worked on in any detail. I know Councillor Fielding is now the Chair of Protection and Community Services and Councillor Havixbeck had that portfolio prior but there’s… You know, this is certainly a signal that is saying we need to get some more information; we need to get a stronger and better relationship with our police community to ensure that we are in fact in the right place with them. I'm always told we have the best police pension in the Country, but this action is certainly telling us or sending a signal to me that maybe we don't. And let's review that and see where we're at.</P>
<P class="p43 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, you know, a part of this… Thank you for the (inaudible), Councillor Swandel. Look, I think the city… we’re obviously hoping that there would be some sort an agreement that</P>

<P class="p19 ft1">February 27, 2013</P>
<P class="p44 ft6">would come into place. We know the parameters of what the agreement is in terms of what needs to happen for all partners to agree upon it. We know that solvency exemption… you know, that there is parameters in the legislation that’s there that allows us to do it. There’s been a number of public sector employees that have chosen to take that exemption <NOBR>--</NOBR> I think it's the Winnipeg Civic Employee’s pension, Manitoba Health Care employees, both the University of Manitoba and University of Winnipeg, the Superannuation Board, as well as the Manitoba Teachers. There also is a number of police jurisdictions across the Country that have looked at this. You’re looking at places like Vancouver, Alberta, Regina, Saskatoon, the R.C.M.P…. I think Ontario as well has been a part of that. And really, the impact is great, I mean there’s – we're talking about $130 million which could represent close to 20 <NOBR>--</NOBR> I believe $25 million – $24 million on a yearly basis which is a 5.6 percent increase on taxes if you look at kind of our revenue that we bring in. So it is a major issue that are there.</P>
<P class="p23 ft6">To be fair, you know, this is something that all members whether it be current employees of the Police or retired employees of the Police have the opportunity to vote on it. That’s what is in the agreement and that is… A letter was sent out by the Board of the pension plan to address this. And at the end of the day, it is upon the membership to make that vote and they clearly have voted. They had some concerns with the solvency exemption piece. We don't think that it's a concern because we don't ever see the plan ceasing to exist right now. But what we're doing is in terms of financial basis instead of taking a 5 percent – 5 or 6 percent increase in taxes just to pay the pension fund, $25 million, 130 over the last number of years. We've taken the act of taking a line of credit which we think makes a lot sense. Basically it allows us to get a letter of credit with the banks, allows us to fulfil that obligation that's a part of it. We would have preferred going the other avenue but we respect their vote and their opinion on it and as such we’re following the legislation.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2">So is it a perfect scenario? Absolutely not, but we're doing, I think, the best we can. The line of credit that we're talking about does have some implications in terms of our financial piece – our credit rating could somewhat be impacted by it but we think this is a responsible approach. But in the end of the day, we’re going to respect the vote that came in and democracy wins in terms of the police pension but we would have wished it would have come in a different way. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will be supporting it and go from there. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p45 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further comments? Mayor Katz to close.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I do appreciate the comments from both Councillors. I also believe that Councillor Swandel is very much aware of exactly what's been going on with this issue of solvency. As I can tell you we've been doing this for well over a year right now.</P>
<P class="p46 ft6">There is a process in place, Mr. Speaker. We went through the process and in the end, the members of the Winnipeg Police Association basically voted against solvency exemption. It's absolutely correct that other unions here in the Province, as well as other police associations throughout the Country, have accepted the solvency exemption. And the facts are that there is probably minimal risk, ‘cause the only risk that actually is out there is if the City were to ever go broke. And if the City were to go broke there would be a lot bigger problems out there. So… but that’s it. But the facts are that the membership had a concern, whether valid or not, they had a concern and they voted and it is what it is. That's how the system works. You don't always like the end result. And I can assure you we would have all been a lot happier if they agreed to solvency exemption but they did not. The facts are that we were going to have to come up with all of the monies, about $26 million, until this recently came about that we could address this issue with a letter of credit. I think you can see the big difference by using a letter of credit that's a major advantage to us. And we're hoping, because up until recent times it wasn't really specified by the Winnipeg Police Association that they would accept the letter of credit. But now we believe they will and if that's the case, this is obviously something that will move forward. If not, we have serious problems to address and they get worse and worse every year for the next five years. So, I'm hoping this does put it to bed. It will be accepted, and we can move on. And I would say to Councillor Swandel that if we were to view the Winnipeg Police Association Pension Plan, compared to others, I think you'll find it's a very good plan. No one has ever said it's not. Whether it's the best in the Country, I’m not going to say that. It's a very good pension plan. No one has any disagreement about that. This really is an issue about solvency exemption and it could also be about future negotiations. As you know a lot of things come into play down the road but here is where we are today. We can either spend approximately $26 million or we can go get a letter of credit.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you Mayor Katz. That concludes the discussion on Item 6. All those in favour? Opposed? Carried. Number 9.</P>

<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, you heard from the delegation earlier and I actually want to take the opportunity to thank both the Garden City Community Centre as well as the East End Community Centre. Keeping in mind these are volunteers, hockey moms, hockey dads, board members, other volunteers. Basically, the heart and soul of these enterprises that make it tick; something that we could never ever accomplish. And so I thank them for coming forward and actually working with our administration and coming up with a plan. I think we all know the problems that we have with our recreational infrastructure. It wasn't that long ago, it was just before I elected, when I believe it was the PUFFSreport that came out, which basically was condemning our recreation infrastructure with the bad shape it's in. It was buried and finally it came out; and everybody on Council got to see it; and we know it's in a bad state of repairs. And that included community centres, that included hockey rinks, all the way down the road. I mean, it was not a good situation – swimming pools as well. And here’s a way of addressing them and it's a perfect scenario. It's a partnership between the Community Centre, between the City, and the Province, all stepping up to the table. In one instance, it's a $9 million partnership, <NOBR>one-third,</NOBR> <NOBR>one-third,</NOBR> <NOBR>one-third;</NOBR> in another instance it's a $17 million partnership, <NOBR>one-third,</NOBR> one- third, <NOBR>one-third.</NOBR> The difference is, is that although these are still <NOBR>city-owned</NOBR> facilities; they will be run and operated by the community centres… to be very frank, do things we that we could never do and they do it very successfully. And we're also dealing with two community centres that have a phenomenal track record, the way they raise funds, the way they pay off loans. I mean I think we're very fortunate and as a result of the hard work done by the department, I can tell you they've been contacted by other community centres, other community groups who want to do this as well. I should also add, Mr. Speaker, that I was contacted just recently about doing the Council seminar, so every Councillor knows exactly how this works and that is being set up as well. So that will be my introduction and then I'll address any questions that may come up.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Sharma followed by Councillor Fielding, Gerbasi and Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p26 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am rising in support of this item. As Mayor Katz just said, it's very apparent our arena facilities are dated and an overhaul like this is long overdue. We know that it's not financially feasible to restore our old arenas. This project, Mr. Speaker, is an example of what is possible when governments and communities work together to come up with creative and innovative solutions to build strong and vibrant communities for today and for the future. The efforts of the Garden City Community Centre Board is outstanding. I know the committee has worked on this project for several years. I would like to thank Lorrie Rogalka, who spoke on behalf of the Community Centre today, and also thanks to Roger Tuck for being here; I see him in the gallery. Both of these individuals, Mr. Speaker, along with their committee, have been instrumental in building a successful proposal. Their proposal is solid and viable and their proven track record, as Mayor Katz also said, is commendable. The creation of this hundred thousand square foot multiplex will provide families with up to date recreational facilities that will be enjoyed for many, many years to come. This will become a true recreation hub, Mr. Speaker, complete with a community centre, soccer complex, twin arena, fitness centre and an additional 3,000 square feet of programming space and it's all incorporated under one roof. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Garden City Community Centre Board for their vision and dedication that has helped to bring this idea to life. This is indeed an important project for Garden City and for the surrounding communities. I asked my colleagues on Council for their support in moving this forward. Once completed, it will be a project that we can all be proud of. And as Lorrie Rogalka said earlier, it will be a place where families and community members can join in a variety of activities and everyone can feel a true sense of community. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks, Councillor Sharma. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p50 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope you grant me a little bit of latitude, I'm going to probably speak about this project as well as the next project, you know, combined because it's the arena projects. And, you know, for the last 2 or 3 months since I moved into my new role, there has been a lot of talk with arenas and, you know, I think sometimes if you have a bit of patience, you have great things that are happening. And I think these are two examples of what's going on in our community. You’ve got a $9 million investment in one, $17 million investment in the community, $26 million investments in arenas and I can tell you these make a difference in people's lives. You've got a great partnership… I know the Mayor had spoke of it, Councillor Sharma had spoke of it, between two levels of government and always criticism that levels of government can’t get their act together to get projects done. Well in this case you have partners in the community that were willing to put up some dollars, you got the City, you got the Province working together to develop some <NOBR>--</NOBR> I think some very good projects in and of itself. I like <NOBR>--</NOBR> also like the fact that the</P>

<P class="p44 ft6">community is operating a lot of these new facilities that are there. You have their role, they’ve got a vested interest in making these communities, making these arenas work, to a way that's going to make sense for the area. I think the approach is taken in terms of a multiplex makes a lot of sense. Back in the day when you created these arenas, the models just don't work right now. You have some great complexes in your ward, Councillor Nordman, the private sector came to the table as well through the Iceplex and I can tell you how important an amenity that is has been to our communities. So if you create some of these multiplexes and approve some of the facilities… I know the East End one you have improvements in terms of some of the washroom facilities, the change room facilities. And in some of these older facilities, I know in Vimy, which is one of the ones we’re looking to decommission that’s in St. James. I can tell you from playing there, as a young lad, as well as everything else, you have change rooms where you’ll need four change rooms for two teams to play; it’s just ridiculous in terms of the approach. So I think the multiplex is something that works really well and I'm excited about that.</P>
<P class="p51 ft9">Also, I think the investments in our community, whether you have Vimy, whether you have other areas that rinks are being decommissioned because they’re not… the dollars and cents you’d need to upgrade them doesn't make sense and so the dollars being invested here… great investments into our community but also keeping some of the recreational dollars there. I know with the Vimy, for instance when it's decommissioned, sold off the proceeds of that sale will stay in St. James, in their community, just talking for our own areas, to reinvested in recreation centres. So I think it's a win/win/win for the community; it’s also great having community partnerships that are there. The two that we're talking about, obviously <NOBR>non-profit,</NOBR> you know, that would be running, operating these facilities. And I’d like to also say that some of the private sector ones that have been brought up, through the Feds and the Province and the stimulus dollars through the Iceplex. Private centres is not a dirty word, in fact they are working quite well in and of itself. But these are some great examples of what can happen. I can tell you, you know, City Hall has taken a lot of criticism over the last <NOBR>6-7</NOBR> months. Just you know, from a group of fellows playing hockey on Thursday night after this, there is a lot of talk and excitement about what the City is doing in terms of arenas. So it makes sense going forward and excited to see a number of other proposals that come forward over the next number of months and we'll wait and see what can happen but some great things are happening in our arenas and very excited to be part of that process. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p52 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p53 ft9"><SPAN class="ft10">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will be supporting these proposals that are in front of us and I do thank the Mayor for agreeing to put on a seminar for Councillors, which I requested when I saw the press releases announcing these wonderful projects. I just wanted to point out, I don't <NOBR>--</NOBR> I appreciate what is happening, I don't really appreciate how it's happening, because I think Council needs to be part of this whole discussion. It needs to be a big picture discussion, and a plan for our city about our recreation that isn't just a press release appearing, saying we're doing this one over here and this one over here when it's already decided and everything. And the rest of Council has been unaware and hasn't had any information about – that RFP went out about the request for – I don't know if it's RFP or expression of interest or whatever it was... It went out about the arenas. And there really hasn't been a clear information available to many of us about what happened with some of those other proposals from other parts of the City that aren't getting these particular projects. I was out in the community on the weekend in Fort Garry and people were saying what's happening? What's happening with our proposal and I'm a Councillor and I don't know anything, so that was why I asked for a seminar. And I also wanted to say that there is other aspect to this, other than just we're putting in more sheets of ice. We have to look at the whole picture about how much ice time is available for basic city programs like learn to skate, you know, who is going to decide the public policy around ice availability? Because there is going to be all these separate – even if they are controlled by community centres, you know, it's the community centre for that area, it’s not necessarily looking at a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> plan. And I would like assurance that there will be ice time and affordable learn to skate programs for everyone and all those things considered; and maybe that's all been considered and maybe is there no issue to be concerned about. But I have not – I don't feel I've been fully informed about this. What we're doing is rather than saying here’s our plan for arenas over the next 10 years or here’s the ones we're looking and here’s the ones we’re moving or considering closing and all that. Instead of a plan, we have a press release with an announcement And yeah, they are great announcements… I'm sure the communities that are getting those – that ice time is very happy and all that. So, I think you get my point. I just think that Councillors, first of all, need to be informed and I have to admit I'm not. So I can't answer questions when people come up to me on the street and ask what's happening with their arenas and our arenas throughout the city. And I also am a little concerned about the financial plan for all of this as well. These projects are great but we just went through a budget process. These weren't part of that process. We're adding more operating costs going forward which maybe those are the right priorities and maybe that's what we should be doing. But it was outside of our regular budget process. We've already got a $75 million shortfall for the upcoming operating budget next year and we’ve made the decision that these things are the priorities and maybe they should be… I'm not saying they’re not, but it's out of context. It's a press release and an announcement outside of our budget, outside of an overall recreation strategy and outside of the awareness of individual City Councillors. So having said that I will support the projects, they are too far down the road and they are good projects. I thank the Mayor</P>

<P class="p20 ft2">for responding very quickly to my request for a council seminar and committing to that and to the Chair of the Standing Committee for that as well. Those are my concerns which I just wanted to put on the record, thank you Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks, Councillor Gerbasi. Councillor Orlikow followed by Councillor Mayes, Steen and Eadie.</P>
<P class="p54 ft9"><SPAN class="ft10">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Alright, well I'm sure we all would like to say something about this project because this project and both projects, because they are actually – it's a very good moment for Winnipeg. When we first started off on this journey about arenas, we had a proposal to do for four – <NOBR>four-plexes</NOBR> in quadrants of the City and shut down local arenas and move them all out to the – in my opinion, the suburbs. But my concern we would have <NOBR>four-plexes</NOBR> in the outside corners and that should do us fine. But that terrified me, mostly because how will people afford to go there? I talked to the MTS people, I’ve talked to a few other people, the costs associated with running a <NOBR>four-plex</NOBR> is not as simple as that; and how could a community group bring up the revenue to actually afford a <NOBR>four-plex?</NOBR> So my concern was that we were going to get out of the arena business completely and just dump that off on the private sector, hope for the best; it's not our problem anymore. Well that proposal died, quietly, nicely – very happy about that. And what's come up out of its place is a wonderful program, where community centres and the local communities are getting together and rallying around to develop programs that meet their community needs; not the city's <NOBR>four-plex</NOBR> needs, but the community needs and they are all different, depending on what the neighbourhood needs, based upon what program is available or not available. And that's the way I believe we should have started off. I think this as we ended up, ‘cause you know, as they say it's where you end up is where it’s important; so even though I'm terrified where we started off, I'm very happy where we ended up. I think this idea of looking at what type of programming is needed in neighbourhoods, not based upon the City at whole but looking at the neighbourhood. Do we need more iceplexes? Do we need plex spaces? Do we need this kind of stuff to make programming happen? What about free skate? Well if you have a <NOBR>four-plex,</NOBR> they don't have a lot of free skate going on at the MTS plex because they can’t afford it. They have – what they do there is they make a lot of money from hockey camps and big camps that make… but again that's not something that's really available as easily to community centres and I would say that shouldn't be their goal. Their goal is to work with the kids and the parents in their local community to provide the basic skating, how to skate, learn to skate, real <NOBR>low-level,</NOBR> kind of, community development modelling. And then after that, the kids get really excited about it and want to carry on, the parents continue wanting to be hockey parents or whatever type of rink parents they are, free skating… whatever it is off they go, and then they can go up to that level. But at the beginning my worry was that we would lose that community development model which is so important for all athleticism. We need to have those kids having fun at the beginning, at least into, I would say, up to age 10, again I'll leave that up to the their own little parents, but again that's the idea. And you know what? There is not a lot of money to be made doing that. That is what the governments are responsible for. And again, we will help community centres. I know that the river – the Central Corydon Corridor Community Centre has a modelling that we hope to be successful shortly. But again to answer what Councillor Gerbasi says, in the business plan, the community centres, in the ones I've read, are quite clear that their passion and their drive is to provide opportunities for all kids in their neighbourhoods and all of the City of Winnipeg, they’re not going to aband. That's wonderful and that's what we need. We need to have the free skates, we need to have the family skates; we need to have all that. We need to have a place where the guys can go at ten o'clock at night and play hockey in their own neighbourhood because again all this does is generate community development. Once you have neighbours meeting neighbours, that actually has a huge spillover into many benefits for the whole City of Winnipeg. So again, terrified where this program started off to – very happy where we landed, so again I'll be supporting both.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p26 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A number of good comments. This has kind of evolved into a bit of debate about the arenas and where we're going, which I think is healthy. I've certainly been one of the people who’ve asked a lot of questions. Someone began an interview with me, a couple weeks ago, saying now you’re the critic for arenas and I think – how did I end up with that? And part of that is that I've asked a lot of questions over the past few months, so I am very pleased to see some action taking place here to see these arenas going forward. My concern is… and I'm very pleased to hear we’re going to have a council seminar on this whole issue of recreation infrastructure. I think what would be useful before that though is a little better handle on the numbers… and I've been bugging Councillor Fielding for months about the facility condition indexes and I see here they are for 2011 now updated from 27 as appendix B on number 9. But if you look at the facility condition indexes and I'm still waiting for St. Vital Arena, this is month 5, but I’ll deal with that separately. But we do have the numbers for the other arenas, but ironically if you look at these numbers verses the 2007 numbers some arenas have actually gotten better and some have gotten worse. I was looking at St. – Sargent Park, Councillor Fielding appears to have solved the crisis at Sargent Park because it’s gone from .62 down to .31. Unfortunately while he was doing that, the one in his own ward, St. James, has shown having gone from .23 up to .38. So I'm being facetious to make the point that these…</P>

<P class="p19 ft1">February 27, 2013</P>
<P class="p57 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Some politicians would have gotten up here and said they’ve solved the crisis but to his credit Councillor Fielding didn't say that. The real – the underlying problem here is it's a ratio that if it costs you $1.5 million to fix up the building and the building is worth 3 million, your FCI is .5. But if you wait a couple of years and the building goes up in value, say to 6 million because the underlying land has gone up in value, your FCI is down to .25; you have miraculously improved the problem. The arena has actually gotten worse, it probably costs more to get the thing back into shape but the ratio is misleading. So in short, I've been asking for these ratios, now that I see the comparison, I'm not sure these are actually worth the paper they are written on. The real number here that we need to have for the council seminar is, what does it cost to get these things up to an acceptable level and what would it cost to replace them? So if we can get those numbers in advance of the council seminar, I think that would be very useful because frankly, some of the <NOBR>--</NOBR> the Vimy was the worst before, it remained the worst in the most recent ranking. So that's one that we should be decommissioning, but some of the others that moved wildly up and down as the value of the land has changed but the state of the arena hasn't really changed. So I know we’ve got serious issues in the South. I know Bertrand and Maginot are very high up on the list of the ones with problems, and that's certainly something I know Councillor Vandal wants to look at and I would like to look at for the Southeast quadrant, now that we’ve got some projects in the Northwest and Northeast. So I do think this is a positive step; I don't want to sound negative. I do want to see some pretty clear numbers though on what’s the state of the crisis? I think with the way we were defining the crisis before is with this FCI ratio and that has proven to be very much a moving and misleading target. So my final comments are there were some – I know if Councillor Wyatt were here he’d be saying that he went out of his way to talk about protecting the learn to skate programs that are at the City arena, at Michener, that are moving into the community centre. I think he was conscious of protecting those, in fact he was even talking about even protecting the name Roland Michener having a park, having a street. So I think he was very conscious about losing that for his community. So I do think we have to keep an eye on the programming that’s going to take care – take place at the community centres if we go this way. But also, I think if we can sit down, take a comprehensive look, as some of the other Councillors said, at the real, the hard numbers, the dollar figures and we can decide okay we’ve got the dough to go one in the Southeast, one in the Southwest maybe or something broader than that. But I appreciate the report, I'll be voting for it and I appreciate Councillor Fielding getting some of these numbers, but the real numbers that we need will hopefully be with the council seminar.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks, Councillor Mayes. Somebody who knows something about ice, Councillor Steen.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Laughter) About ice, yeah, but… I'm just <NOBR>--</NOBR> I will be supportive of this because I think replacing old arenas with duplexes is going to save us money in the future. But my question is, why we - - it's not a question of course but a debate. I have not seen an arena plan for the City. And now it seems like we're going to each community club is doing their own thing. If we had a plan, the most cost effective is building <NOBR>four-plexes,</NOBR> in the long run and saving the City money would be <NOBR>four-plexes.</NOBR> Because you need one ice plant, two zambonis… for every single arena you need one ice plant and one zamboni. So, when we’re doing duplexes, we're improving but four- plexes would be the most cost effective and that's where why I wonder – I haven't seen a seminar coming forward on doing a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> thing but I still gonna support these two and I think it's a good thing. Maybe <NOBR>four-plexes</NOBR> are for the next time in the future, 50 years from now, but it will happen. (Laughter) But maybe it's because we need to – the closeness of the communities but it's easy to get to the arenas along Lagimodiere, Bishop Grandin, Chief Peguis, wherever now. We had <NOBR>four-plexing</NOBR> along those lines because I know when my kids grew up I had to drive and find these arenas all over and that was quite a challenge in itself. And we're doing better but I think we could do even better, My Speaker, thank you.</P>
<P class="p56 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks Councillor Steen. Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p54 ft9"><SPAN class="ft10">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes… thank you, Speaker Nordman. It's been a lot said about this particular plan in the – for ice and as well as the other and, of course, I will be voting to support the Garden City and the other sheet of ice that is in the plan. But you know… and I really <NOBR>--</NOBR> you know, I really thank the community members from Garden City. My kids have played sports out of Garden City, and back and forth in this particular area and so I really appreciate the work that's gone on there and I know that there’ll be many kids and adults who will benefit from having this other <NOBR>two-sheets</NOBR> of ice. I wanted to mention just about process though because when Councillor Fielding stood up and he said there has been a lot of discussion about rinks and you get to have some discussions and I guess you have a special place when you are the Chairperson of a Standing Committee but, you know, there could be better sharing of information I believe and I think that, you know, the political aspects of moving forward with renewing our ice rinks, I think is… that's really important. But you know, it really should involve all of Council and more discussion. I know that Councillor Mayes as soon as he was elected said, well where is this hockey rink plan? What's going on? And Councillor Steen has mentioned that it doesn't seem like there is a big plan at this point. I wanted to say a couple more things about this because in West Kildonan, we have the West Kildonan arena and it's been a community centre run now for quite some time, and we</P>

<P class="p60 ft9">really do have to thank the amount of energy that our volunteers in the communities at the community centres put in the time that they do and I know there’s a heavy amount of time that was put in at Garden City, all the time as well, and at all community centres. And, there is a number of them, but, I wanted to point something out because politically, you know, I just <NOBR>--</NOBR> it really irritates me when I hear about things like "well, you know, the community does it better." The government doesn't do it well. Well the reality is all these arenas were built like 40, 50 years ago and, of course, they deteriorate. And what we need to remember here is while we have a couple of new sheets of ice in Garden City, what kind of support are we going to be providing to the volunteers 40 and 50 years down the road when that facility at Garden City gets really old? We have to be cognizant of that and that's really what happened here. With our ice rinks what happens over time is, you know, you have budgetary problems, you're trying to meet all the needs of the City, the roads, all those kinds of things and what happened, really, is that City Council neglected fixing up these arenas and investing more money. You know, I have the West Kildonan arena in my ward and it was described about having to have four different change rooms to allow teams to change and that sort of thing. Well you know, if we put some investment over time into expanding the dressing rooms for example, at the West Kildonan arena, you know, that would be a better facility. But you know, we – so what I'm hoping here is… we're moving forward, but I want to make sure and we need to remember this, and hopefully it's recorded for the future and somebody continues to bring this up, but you know, somebody needs to remind it that these community centre groups, these volunteers, need to have the investment and the support from City Council on an ongoing basis to achieve what we believe is a good goal, which is to allow our kids, adults and everybody to skate because we all love hockey and skating is great. We're decommissioning Old Ex. I played hockey at Old Ex and I played hockey at the West Kildonan arena and I have to say that when we're talking about the decommissioning of that, nobody talked to me… You know, I think it's great that Wosack is looking at taking over the Old Ex arena and that's a good thing but you know, this stuff just pops up. Like, there’s no consultation with other Councillors or discussion about what's going on and I don't think that's right. So if we're moving forward with more sheets of ice, I think that at least, you know, where this stuff is happening and in the areas that they are, the Councillors should be engaged on an ongoing basis as to what is the status of what we're doing with these rinks. Councillor Mayes points out the two arenas that are getting really old and I remember my dad playing at one of those arenas. And you know, they’re old and yeah, we have to replace them and whether it's the private sector or the public sector or it’s a community centre group, we have to remember that if we want that ice and those arenas maintained we have to invest and improve them. If we don't, if we neglect them which we have done with some of our arenas and you know, we have these special formulas, Councillor Mayes has gotten us through some of the maze of the numbers, and it's – to me, it's quite boggling. So, and just in terms of <NOBR>four-plexes</NOBR> and driving around and moving around, you know, the thing about hockey is when you have community centres and those kind of things, you know, you’re West K. right? So that’s the team you play for, there’s a lot of great hockey teams that I can remember in the day and there’s a pride in your community in playing hockey for your community and so, you know, those kind of things happen as well. And I think that just moving totally to <NOBR>four-plexes</NOBR> and moving them out to busy regional streets, I don't necessarily think is necessarily the most appropriate way to move ahead with sheets. But, if an area looks like they can decommission a number of arenas, maybe there is a need to put a <NOBR>four-plex</NOBR> but maybe that <NOBR>four-plex</NOBR> goes <NOBR>--</NOBR> and I know in my ward there’s no way that we could put two sheets of ice on the footprint at West K. But you know, there are other places where there’s enough land and you can build a <NOBR>four-plex.</NOBR> So if we're ever going to be moving ahead with building <NOBR>four-plexes</NOBR> maybe we could keep them closer to the inner city so that some from the suburbs can drive in a bit and that might be a concept to look at and so… Anyway I thank the people who – the administration and people who put this plan together for these two new sheets of ice, I know that they’re up in the Northwest quadrant in our area of the city. They’re going to really appreciate all the work that the Garden City Community Centre volunteers put into this plan and so I thank you very much. But you know, we have to dispel some myths in 40 or 50 years we better be supporting those community centres and those groups because they’re going to need help to get their arenas renovated because they will deteriorate.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks Councillor Eadie. Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't want to take too long and belabour some of these points. I am supportive of the current plan. I think though, looking around the table, I am one of the only hockey moms, or hockey parents around and I can say that being in some of these arenas four to six times a week with two boys in hockey and going throughout the city, they are literally falling apart with taps that can't be repaired any more, dressing rooms that are beyond being able to clean by our volunteers or by staff, and we also have a shortage. Teams are continuously trying to find ice time. They can't find it in the city. They can't – they have to go to, I know from <NOBR>Charleswood-Tuxedo</NOBR> area people are go to Sanford, they are going to Stoney Mountain area, Stonewall, to have practices. And so, you know, I think we're at an important point here. Council has adopted a policy that is one for one. That is, you build a new sheet of ice, you decommission one. And I’d like to point out, that I think that that's an important concern. Many of our current rinks were built in the 1960s. If you think of where our population has gone since the 1960s we've probably gone up by – trying to figure that out – 30 to 50 percent of an increase. Our rinks from that era are old and tired and we've all heard that. But with the population growth being so significant, I'm not sure that enough analysis has been done to look at whether we in fact have the right number of rinks to match the programming and the</P>

<P class="p20 ft2">population. So I just caution that perhaps as we have a council seminar, we consider it with open minds; whether one for one is the best way to manage. And maybe we look at some changes to that form of council policy. You can't build another one unless you decommission one currently so we need to look at that and with that amount of growth. So I am supportive and I just wanted to have those comments on the record. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p62 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Orlikow, would you like to speak again?</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Just a quick… more of an inquiry and I'll come back. We're making – we all happy now? So I just want to ask the other question. What happens in this case, a lot of these programs are being funded through loans either through the Community Centres themselves are getting loans or the City is helping out with some loans. What protection does the City have if the Community Centre can't fulfil their obligations?</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Ok, it’s a question that will get answered in the close. Seeing no further comments, Mayor Katz. (Laughs) Lots of information.</P>
<P class="p63 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I very much appreciate all the comments that were made by the Councillors so let me just try and enlighten you to a few facts. First of all, you know, you can look at any report you want, you can look at any index, no matter how they do it, you heard Councillor Mayes say it's not worth the paper it's written on. If you want to know the state of our hockey rinks, Councillor Havixbeck has given you the answer. Talk to any hockey mom or dad, they'll give you the answer. They’re terrible.</P>
<P class="p64 ft6">Next, let's just move on from there. No more debate on that issue, Mr. Speaker. The other scenario is, what I think some people here don't understand, is that the reason we are here today, with what I call a success story, is because of the way we started the process. As a result of that process we found some – some groups who were genuinely interested. It took a lot of dialogue to get to where we are and we've now created a template, okay? Now, you can debate whether you like <NOBR>two-plex,</NOBR> the <NOBR>three-plex,</NOBR> the <NOBR>four-plex.</NOBR> <NOBR>Four-plexes</NOBR> are extremely sexy but let me share something with you, Mr. Speaker. We have one <NOBR>four-plex</NOBR> in the City of Winnipeg, it’s the MTS Ice…. Just for the record, the Federal and Provincial government gave a $12 million grant to make that become a reality, so let's make sure everybody here is aware of that. Sounds to me like a lot of people aren't – cost a lot of money. And is anybody prepared to do that? Is there any group out there prepared to take on that type of a scenario? The reason these work, and I will address Councillor Orlikow's question, is that anybody who has to submit a business plan, we've worked with some of these organizations, they have business plans, we have our corporate finance approve them, plus they have a track record of doing projects, paying back and raising phenomenal money out there in the community; that's why these were the ones that are going forward and they came first.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Now you know, it's funny some people weren't exactly happy the way they heard about it. Mr. Speaker, I don't know about you, I opened the paper one day, guess what I see? Charles Barber. I don't know anything about it but there is a group out there that wants to do something in Councillor Orlikow's ward. I read it in the paper, never heard a word about it, but you know what? I consider that positive. There is a group that’s interested in addressing an issue because we have some of these facilities that have five to $8 million in deferred maintenance; you’re talking serious money. And just obviously <NOBR>--</NOBR> and I don't blame in any way shape or form, but to share with Councillor Gerbasi, this should have no impact on our operating budget because the plan that's put together to approve these, there will be a sheet added and then a sheet decommissioned. And for Councillor Eadie's sake that doesn't take place without consultation with the area Councillor. The City is cut up into quadrants. If you build one, then you take one from that quadrant. I think you might even know that first hand, Mr. Speaker. And when it comes to the budget process, what happens, the reason this works is because of the money that we are losing and pumping into existing facilities, that money is what helps us pay for the money that we're putting into the project. The only downside that exists is that when I said we have a partnership, Mr. Speaker, the Province's money is coming from MWIP and that's a great fund. The dilemma we have, Mr. Speaker, is that the MWIP money was already allocated by the City of Winnipeg. We always take the MWIP money and we allocate it to projects in the City. The Province has come forward, and they have the right to do so, because we renewed MWIP. In the old system that's the way we did it; the new system, they want to decide where it's going. So now, since we've allocated that money, we do have to <NOBR>back-fill</NOBR> the Province's contribution, which was stated right open in a motion that was made previous and that's how it works. Other than that, this is a perfect model for moving forward and the initiative comes from finding a partner who wants to participate with the City, with the Province and has a good track record. The realities are that will only take you so far, Mr. Speaker, because there are other parts of the City that also need new facilities that may not have that strong, volunteer base and that's where we have to get involved to a bigger extent. I certainly hope that everybody supports what I think is a great news story, Mr. Speaker.</P>

The Province’s flood report is coming out today and in 2011, this City took unprecedented steps in trying to prepare to make sure that the City of Winnipeg would not experience problems with our emergency measures, and it worked out very, very good and I wanted to say that as part of this, that our emergency measures administration and people are very good and it was a great way that we put into place the proper resources so that we would be ready in case there would be some serious flooding and so I’m asking our Mayor if we would be able to have in the next week or two, a seminar just to get up to speed where we’re going with our potential flooding situation this year.</P>

<P class="p77 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly agree with Councillor Eadie. Our departments, and I say department”s”, did a phenomenal job in addressing those issues and kept damages to a minimum, and I certainly would hope that we could do the exact same. I can assure you they are preparing and I will be happy to look into that as per Councillor Eadie’s request.</P>
<P class="p62 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes thank you, Speaker Nordman. Just because there is so much information, there is…I mean, it’s the first flood forecast and we’re kind of worried about what’s happened in Fargo this winter, plus we can all see how much snow is packed up and so, I’m not sure if…my question actually is I can’t remember if the Mayor is actually the political point person on our emergency measures. If you could answer that question?</P>
<P class="p62 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I will once again assure the Councillor that I will get the process going and make sure that Council is updated. I’d be happy to do that.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Good. Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. During the budget discussion that we had this year, I raised a concern about the lack of money that remains in the Heritage Investment Reserve and just to remind everyone that this fund is intended to be a revolving fund for heritage tax credits. This program has been around for over 25 years and it normally pays itself back. Unfortunately…well not necessarily unfortunately but for various reasons, we’ve used some of those funds for grants; to make some very important projects happen. We’ve extended the time on some of these for very important heritage projects and we’ve done some really amazing things with that. We’ve even raided some of that reserve occasionally in a budget process just to balance our budget unfortunately; but the result is that this year, and I’ve raised this at all the different committee processes through the budget, and that fund is basically down to nothing and unless we replenish that fund, there will not be any money available for heritage programs that come forward including things such as the Cathedral in St. Boniface that we just declared a historic site, which obviously should have been already as a national historic site. So there are a number of projects that we’ll probably want to see proceeding even this year and there’s no money in there. So I raised it with the Mayor through the budget process. You seemed receptive and everyone seemed to listen but nothing was added into the budget, so I really would like to know if we’re going to take action on this issue or we’re just simply going to tell people “sorry, no heritage tax program this year and no more redevelopment of our heritage assets until we find some more money”.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I thank Councillor Gerbasi and we have discussed this, and it was my opinion that this is something that has to be addressed and I’ve already shared that with Councillor Gerbasi. I’ve also spoken to the Director. We do have a small amount of money left. We are still dealing with applications coming forward and I do believe that this is something that Council will have to address when those applications come forward. The Director is away right now but when they come back I will get updated and we’ll look at the options that are there for us to basically make sure we’re able to continue this knowing that what’s been done to date has all been very positive and we’ve gotten a lot of good things out of this, so I do believe that this fund should have funds in it to address when applications come forward and that’s something that we are working on.</P>
<P class="p80 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p39 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Mayor. My other question has to do with the Esplanade Riel. I heard…I’ve had my briefing through the media; unfortunately it’s the only source of a briefing I’ve really had on this even though I’m one of the Councillors that abuts the bridge as Councillor Vandal and I are the two Councillors and I’m a little disappointed. I’ve heard nothing except that an RFP has gone out, and I also read in the media that Councillor Vandal raised some interesting suggestions of options to use the facilities on the bridge as public space, perhaps some partnership with the Forks. There’s a number of creative options we could look at with this…what is now this infrastructure piece that is now the cover photo on every tourist magazine in the City and across the Country. You know, we should have a policy discussion about how we’re going to handle that and we haven’t and so I guess I’d like to know if you can provide an update to us about this and what do you foresee happening here?</P>

<P class="p26 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, on the floor of Council several months ago, it was pointed out to us that there might be restaurants or restaurateurs who might be interested and would be paying more than what we were getting from the current tenant. The Department has put out an RFP. It closed about 10 days ago I think, in that area. I do know that there were responses that came in and I know that the Department is going through them and when those responses are dealt with, we’ll certainly have something to share with Council. The other side of the coin is I’m very cognizant of Councillor Vandal’s comments. We’ve talked about this on many occasions; looking to see if there’s maybe a combination if you can do something with the private sector, with the community. Maybe that will come up in the near future once we are made aware of who’s put in the proposals and exactly what they are. So I would ask Councillor Gerbasi to just be patient because she knows the process is flowing. They have closed and they’re reviewing it and if Councillor Gerbasi wishes, as soon as I’m factually made aware of everything, I’d be happy to talk to her anytime.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you. Well I appreciate that. It’s just…I guess I’m wondering if you agree that with issues like this, when it’s such an important attraction; it’s such an important thing for our City, that before an RFP goes out on something like that where there’s policy implications, that the area Councillors and the downtown Councillors, Downtown Committee, it should be a policy discussion. That’s not what happened. Perhaps there’s a chance to do it after the RFP comes in and there will still be an openness to that, but I guess I’m questioning the process itself and asking you if you agree that we could do this better by having those discussions before we send out the RFP?</P>
<P class="p75 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p82 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, with all due respect I would ask Councillor Gerbasi where was she when Councillor Smith said, put it out for an RFP, wecan get more money. I never heard a peep. The Department followed those instructions and did exactly what was requested on this very floor Mr. Speaker!</P>

<P class="p33 ft1">Councillor Smith: <SPAN class="ft2">Can I </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">re-word</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> it?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>I’ll give you another chance.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Are you aware that Phil Sheegl has…</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Again, you can’t use a name.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Are you aware that…I’ll ask you this question. Can any Councillor park his car where the CAO is parking now?</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel</SPAN>: Or their <NOBR>taxi-cab.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Is that the end of the question?</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Yes. Thank you. Mr. Mayor.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to Councillor Smith, Mr. Speaker, I’ll share what I do know. Number one, that this scenario that was described by Councillor Smith was something that was initiated by the prior CAO, Mr. Glen Laubenstein. It was also approved, I should say, or basically discussed with the Winnipeg Parking Authority as well as Building Services and fully supported. That’s what I do know factually. That’s really all I care about at this stage of the game. But if Councillor Smith is looking for a better parking spot, I’ll search high and low to find one for him, Mr. Speaker.</P>

<P class="p84 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions? No. Thank you Councillor Smith. Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Through you to the Mayor, I just want a little further comment. When I was speaking to the police pension solvency issue, I had mentioned the idea, because we could see that there is obviously some sort of a problem here, the idea of doing a review. If the police and the members of the pension plan are seeing that something’s not right I’d like to find out a little bit more as to where we are on a national level and put forward the concept of doing a review and a comparative analysis to see where we are with our police pension in comparison to other jurisdictions, and the Mayor didn’t respond to that when he spoke to it on the item, so you know, if our police are feeling they’re not being treated fairly, I think it’s something that we should be dealing with and I’m inferring that just based on the fact that they wouldn’t give us the solvency exemption which helps everybody and so if there is an issue here I’d like to find that out and I’d like to start with a comparative analysis. Would the Mayor support that concept?</P>
<P class="p56 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I’d be happy to, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Would that require…would the Mayor put a motion forward in that regard or second a motion in that regard?</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>If I’m asked, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Alright, last question. Seeing none. Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p24 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thank you. Get to my notes. Okay, thank you very much. I won’t take 18 minutes. First question is, I’m wondering if the Mayor would be able to look into a matter regarding the Winnipeg Hydro/Manitoba Hydro review that I’ve been asking for for about four months now to the administration. It particularly relates to an issue regarding a redevelopment in the neighbourhood. For myself to go the community I have some concerns about how the Winnipeg Hydro and Manitoba Hydro lands were swapped in the area. I’ve tried to get the report from the administration. I’ve been told that it’s pending and pending and pending, but t’s continually pending, and now the issue is coming to a head where I’m missing that information and I have to make other decisions without that information. So, I’m hoping the Mayor would be able to help get that report. I want you to be aware that I don’t have it yet.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I’m not specifically cognizant of exactly what the Councillor is referring to, but I can assure you that if Councillor Orlikow is looking for some information and contacts me, I’d be happy to do whatever I can to get him the information so that he can make an astute decision on whatever the matter is. It’d be a pleasure.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Second question is: last month I asked a question that seemed to get turned around a bit, so I’m going to try to phrase it in the most neutral position I possibly can. There was a question regarding some equipment that a plant in the City of Winnipeg that our staff may not have the ability to actually know how to use. I haven’t heard back from you yet if that’s actually occurring.</P>
<P class="p62 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p54 ft9"><SPAN class="ft10">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I thank the Councillor for that question. I was hoping he would bring it up today and I specifically remember being asked at the last one and it was the way the question was phrased which I think was inappropriate and not accurate. As you know there are some Councillors and others who like to use the word “privatize” when it doesn’t even exist, but the question very specifically…and I’ll give you the department’s answer, Mr. Speaker. The statement made by the Councillor, wherever it came from, was not true, and firstly, Veolia has not ordered new equipment for the plants. Secondly, City staff are operating and maintaining the plants. Veolia does not have plant operators in Winnipeg. Veolia’s role is to provide advice to the City in order to find optimization. During the course of the capital program, it is very likely that new equipment will be installed which our operators have no familiarity; however they will receive the training required to be able to operate. This has occurred very successfully in the past with other projects</P>

<P class="p20 ft2">including the water treatment plant, the NEWPCC, disinfection, and the WEWPCC biological nutrient removal. And that comes from the Director of the department. I hope that very specifically answers the Councillor’s question.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Last question. My question is regarding…I’m not sure how to phrase this one…do you believe that a senior member of our administration should be negotiating deals or arrangements when they’re also Directors of that same organization we’re dealing with. So, I don’t want to mention names, but we have the…well…you guys can infer what you want. The Blue Bombers Bison Stadium Inc., as we did today, we changed some agreements around a bit. The Board Chair is a member of our senior administration, of the Blue Bombers, Bisons, and so my question is, is that a conflict of interest? Did the person excuse himself from those debates? What’s your perception of that?</P>
<P class="p45 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, we have a representative on BBB, the CAO. Their job, in my opinion, is to protect the interests of the City of Winnipeg. That’s number one. Number two, on the motion that we discussed today, which was number five, I think any Councillor, if they ever put forward such a motion and they were Chair of a Committee, they would call it house cleaning. So let me just clarify exactly what that motion was. It had absolutely zero, zero impact on the City of Winnipeg. What it did Mr. Speaker, as you know, the Provincial Government put up millions of dollars to get this built, and they get repaid from future property and school taxes on the existing site when that happens, which is down the road. And they were the ones…and in the agreement that was put to bed, it specifically said that they get paid. Now what’s happened, the organization has gone out and got a $10 million loan and they want to pay that off first, and the Provincial Government said no problem, we’ll stand behind that, but unfortunately Mr. Speaker, the original agreement specified that the Province gets paid first, so all they’ve done is take a step back. It’s just that simple. For anybody to try and read anything else into it: nonsense. Those are the facts, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Mayor Katz. Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have two relatively brief questions. One pertains to almost everyone in the city and the second one pertains to very few people. The first question is: there are some media reports about the City staff are projecting a very bad year for potholes this year. Understandable given the climate, and I’m wondering if we, as a City, have plans or funds or basically what strategy we have in place if we are saying we anticipate a bad year for potholes. What our plans are to deal with that.</P>
<P class="p85 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to Councillor Mayes, I thank him for the question and yes, with the warm weather, that’s exactly what comes to mind and I can tell you right now that the City already has three crews out there filling potholes, so we’re already out there. In addition to that Mr. Speaker, we’re ramping up as many as six of our road patching machines as well as an additional six hand asphalt crews, so we know what happens, the Department’s on top of it and there’s no question, this will be top of mind for citizens who are driving on our streets, and as we know, potholes are something that unfortunately takes place every spring and it’s going to happen again, and it appears the Department is definitely on top of the situation.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p23 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. With the Jets being in New York yesterday, there was some talk on the radio about a former Winnipegger who was commemorated in Madison Square Garden, Andy Bathgate, and there was regret expressed on the radio about the City of Winnipeg not having done more to celebrate this member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. I see he is in the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and some other local, the other Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame in addition to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Have we…has something been done by the City to commemorate Mr. Bathgate and if the Mayor is willing to build a $15 million arena in St. Vital, I will commit to signing off on the name of Andy Bathgate right here and right now. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p36 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I am one individual on this floor of Council and you may be another and a few others, who actually remember Andy Bathgate. Played for the New York Rangers, played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, in the Hall of Fame, a great hockey player and yes, he is from Winnipeg. I don’t know of anything, Mr. Speaker, that recognizes Andy Bathgate. As you know there have been situations, and I’ll use Jonathan Toews as an example, when they won</P>

<P class="p20 ft2">the Stanley Cup. That initiative came from actually the former Dakota Community Centre. If that’s something that Councillor Mayes would like me to look into, you know, I’ll look into it. I’m certainly not going to make any commitment at this particular point in time on what or if, but you know, it’s something I will certainly look into. I’m not convinced you’re going to see a brand new $15 million arena in St. Vital but you know what? Everybody here should have dreams. That’s very important.</P>
<P class="p21 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Just on that note, we have Sawchuk, Terry Sawchuk, Butch Goring. There’s a few. Yeah. Billy Mozienko absolutely. Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p86 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to go back to something that was brought up earlier. I know that dealing with Intergovernmental Affairs is a very difficult file. Earlier today the Mayor mentioned the MWIP Program and the challenges that come with that. We obviously, we get some “sticker shock” every now and again because we’re not embedded in a process at the Province. They’re not embedded in a process with us when we’re doing budgeting and certainly when we’re making political announcements which is where some of the arena stuff is coming to our plate. I know our good friend from Transcona is unfortunately not here today. He usually takes a pretty hard- nosed approach to dealing with the intergovernmental file, which I’m sure we could all understand. Diplomacy is certainly my preferred approach. I know it’s the Mayor’s preferred approach and I think most of us around here would like to take a more softer approach in dealing with the Province. I’m just wondering, in light of some of the challenges that we have, is there any ongoing conversations with the Province about how we could smooth the waters in dealing with <NOBR>day-to-day</NOBR> issues so that we’re not sort of landing stuff in each other’s laps that are, you know, contrary to working in the best interests of all the people that we represent, that we jointly represent. Are there any ongoing conversations with the intergovernmental folks at the Province about better means of communications and better ways of doing business?</P>
<P class="p56 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, let me emphatically state that this Mayor and this Council have a better working relationship with the Provincial Government than probably in the last twenty years. That’s number one. Number two, the problem is quite simple. We have challenges that need addressing. The Province also has challenges that need addressing, okay? And unfortunately in order to address these challenges, do you know what it takes Mr. Speaker? Money. Dollars and cents. They have a deficit right now. We’re not going to be getting any new incremental money. Anybody who thinks that is dreaming and that’s really what this is all about. It’s not a matter of being best of friends or whatever the case may be. It’s a matter of the money isn’t there. Now in my opinion, there were days gone by when the money was there, and that’s when we should have gotten more, but today it’s extremely challenging at all levels of government, so we’re going to have to get creative. I can tell you, and I would ask anybody to talk to the Premier or any of the Ministers, we have a very good working relationship. Problem is, if it comes to money, that’s a problem unless it’s existing. As soon as you mention the word “incremental” or “in addition to” or “a new project”, that’s where we have problems, and the facts are, with the existing monies that we get, we can’t address the serious issues that we face. I’m not going to give you the speech again about the 65 cents out of every tax dollar that goes to the Province and we get 8 cents and the Feds get 27 cents, you know I could talk about that for hours. I’m not going to. That’s the reality and don’t think for a moment there isn’t a good working relationship, okay. We can do things like that if there’s no money involved, and we have, and I have Ministers coming to my office on a regular basis. When there are problems that require new funding, it’s a problem.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p54 ft9"><SPAN class="ft10">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I didn’t want to get into the specifics of anything. It was more…my question was really directed at process. Again, just to <NOBR>re-state</NOBR> it. Are there any conversations going about how the two levels of government communicate and better processes for communication and understanding the, even the financial worlds that we live in. There are obviously some political differences at times as well, but even the financial wills, and we see this all the time: us trying to predict what’s going to happen in a Provincial budget and then it doesn’t happen the way we do it, so the question is about process. Is there any dialogue going on that says we should be meeting on a regular basis, or these people at different levels should be meeting on a regular basis? Are we trying to establish some procedures that will help put these things out far ahead of them actually being challenges for us with a gun to our head?</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker I can tell you I have spoken to former City Councillors who, many decades ago almost, were involved in a process where they would have informal meetings and they basically told me that really didn’t accomplish anything. The realities are that our administration has a great working relationship with their administration and vice</P>

<P class="p44 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>This report has gone through a lot of iterations, a lot of consultation. The reason it's back here today is again, this Council has already approved the use and the rules surrounding this emerging technology that's certainly very prevalent in our city. The part that was not passed at that time was the portion regarding fees. That hadn't been consulted with various players in the industry. That is now been done; they don't necessarily like where this has gone. The initial proposal would have actually made some billboards more expensive than on the busiest roadways in Canada. The Gardiner Expressway has 200,000 vehicles a day on parts of it. I think our busiest street is Kenaston Boulevard which is, I don’t know, 80 – 85,000 vehicles a day; we were proposing rates higher that were than what they would have been for a comparable billboard in Toronto. They used a lot of the funding basis for an average billboard between Winnipeg and Toronto and used a portion of the market rates. What ended up happening was Toronto had classes of signs, so a <NOBR>super-billboard</NOBR> was done differently. As a result Winnipeg using a square foot rate would have been far higher, so that's where we got the rates that have been provided now by Assessment & Taxation and it’ll for us here today. So I’ll be happy to hear any questions or comments from any of my colleagues.</P>
<P class="p56 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, thank you. Thank you, Speaker Nordman. Yes, the fee… Of course I supported our new By- law related to electronic digital signs and there is a lot of complexity to deal with those signs. And in speaking to the rates that are now being implemented, the tax to put up signs, I think is an important basis in terms of – for the City, there is a cost to dealing with these kind of signs and given today's technology there’s a lot of evaluation that has to go in and time by our staff, administration to make sure that these signs comply and are safe because, you know, the reality is some of these signs can be… Well, I can't see… As I understand it, I have and my wife’s mentioned it often in driving past a new electronic sign that had gone up in a particular place and it just flashed like bright, like really bright and flashed very fast and, you know, that can make driver mistakes. And the reality is, in today's age we got to make sure that with these kind of signs that things are safe for people driving on the streets. And while we do have to consider that in running business you need to promote your business and advertise your business and being a person who’s been involved in business, prior to being a City Councillor, and being involved on two of the business improvement zones. There is a concern with the kind of cost that going to go into putting up new signs. And what I wanted to speak to and make a point on this particular issue though is that there has to be somehow a balance. And while I'm not fully confident that the best way that we came up with what the real cost will be because what we have is if there is a problem with a sign, there’s a complaint space system after the fact if things change because we all know with electronic signs, it's pretty simple to change what it does on the fly. So I'm sure that we will receive many complaints. So I think that at least we've achieved a balance. I know that the industry people themselves have a problem with the still much higher rates but, you know, the reality is there is a cost to the city and I will be voting for the fee structure that's there even though I'm not quite sure there was an exact analysis to say that this is what it really cost the City to do this and then pass that to the sign installers and the businesses that will be putting up signs. So again, I will support this and I think it does achieve a balance though between City cost and the needs of business.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any other comments? To close, Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p24 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you. I thank Councillor Eadie for those comments. Again, the new <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> will certainly bring, I think, some safety and some best practices to the use of these signs while still a very good and appropriate business tool. Hopefully it moves away… I would be supportive of moving even further away from the mobile signs which are, I’d argue, a blight on our streets. I think the proper use of electronic message centres is a good thing for our communities. Again, the charges are for third party advertising signs, not on site advertising. So if you’re a restaurant and you are advertising its wing night you can have that on site.

<P class="p79 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p24 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, recently we had the issue of…well we’ve just had the practice recently of accepting stamped engineered drawings, engineer’s or architect’s work for permit approval. We had the issue of either something going wrong with this where apparently the engineer whose stamp was on it did not actually stamp and sign the drawing. It would seem to me that this type of problem could be easily avoided if the folks who work at the City had to either get verification by phone or by verified email that the engineer had in fact stamped the drawing. I’m just wondering, I don’t know if the Councillor would know yet, but has anybody looked at the processes and ensuring that there’s some sort of direct contact made with the engineer prior to accepting just the stamp on the drawings as work having been done.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I thank the Councillor for the question. Certainly something I will go back to the department and ask if that should be revisited. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any other questions for Property and Development? Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Just a follow up question actually to the situation and evaluation of the permit process. I’m wondering if in examining proper practice and process, if the Chairperson of Property, Planning and Development would consider making sure that all employees who have the public interest at hand do a similar declaration as to their potential interests in businesses and so on, as we do as City Councillors.</P>
<P class="p62 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. At this point I’m going to decline comment because there is an investigation going on right now. We expect to have a report back to the Standing Policy Committee on March 12th, at our March 12th meeting, and if there’s anything identified at that time we’ll certainly look at what the Councillor is speaking on.</P>
<P class="p62 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes as a follow up. It’s just simple. Rather than focusing on a specific situation, do you believe that when the public interest is at hand, that anybody working in that area should have to declare any potential conflicts in a form that we do as Councillors?</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>I would be more than happy to check with our HR processes and that, but I believe there already are safeguards to ensure that City employees are acting in the best interests of the City.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Concluded? Alright. No further questions for Property and Development. Seeing none, we’ll move onto Standing Policy Committee of Protection and Community Services, Report of February 19th. Councillor Fielding.</P>

<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Yes, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce the report and move adoption of Items number 1 and 2.</P>
<P class="p100 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Discussion on that? All those in favour? Opposed? Carried. We have no motions for Protection Community Services… We do have one?</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Councillor Fielding: <SPAN class="ft2">We do.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Oh I’m sorry, yeah… Okay, Councillor Smith and Councillor Eadie have put forward a motion to PCS and we will have an automatic referral on it.</P>

<P class="p79 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>(inaudible) we just approved the <NOBR>by-laws.</NOBR> Do you foresee any hope that we’ll see great delicious food trucks running around the city this summer?</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>He’s on a diet.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Well, you know I’d like to say yes. My waistline would like to say no, but you know, just further to that I think the piece that we brought forward in terms of the <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> great new step forward. I’m going to talk about that but you know we had 6,200 licensed to, this reduces it to 3,350 reductions to it. I think it’s a good balancing act between protecting the public but also reducing the red tape that businesses have to face, so really excited about this <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> I think it makes a lot of sense going forward, so the answer is yes.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p19 ft1">February 27, 2013</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes thank you, and I guess the first question is: could you tell us how many, what kind of businesses actually won’t have to file for permits annually?</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Well there’s a number of businesses in itself. I think we talked in committee about, Dickie Dee was one obviously, but it’s mainly to do obviously with businesses that are handling small items where there isn’t a wash centre that’s there. These are items that, you know, will be I guess excluded or part of that. There’s also items that businesses, some changes in terms of Farmers’ Markets for instance. For instance what would happen is if you’re having a Farmers’ Market before, you’d have to apply for a temporary permit, so every 14 days you’d have to <NOBR>re-apply.</NOBR> The new changes, an example would be you get a seasonal pass which makes it a little bit easier in terms of some of the red tape and that sort, but I truly believe that it’s a good balancing act. Very happy with how the administration brought this forward because I think it makes, it’s just a common sense thing. You know, smaller items like that, whether it be Dickie Dee or others, items like that, you won’t have to go through that regulatory burden that is there, but it also does protect the public which I think is number one important thing, so I think it’s a real common sense piece and happy that we were able to support it.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes. Well, it’s my understanding of course, that EPC and the Mayor appoints the people… committee people to the Police Board. Can you please give us a status of where we are in terms of establishing our Police Board?</P>
<P class="p72 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6"><SPAN class="ft7">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you for the question. I would have hoped that we would have been up and running at this point. I’m excited for that process to start. I think it could have the potential to be a very good thing going forward. There was some training sessions that the Province hosted this weekend. The City is in the process. The police are in the process of doing the background checks. That’s taken a little bit longer than anticipated because some people were on holidays, getting all the information in. I can tell you it’s a very extensive process. Background checks are similar to what they would do for constables when they’re checking. There’s quite a big interview process that is going, so I’d like to say that, you know, we’ll have the names finalized over the next number of…two weeks and it will come to Council in March. I was once again hopeful that it would come in February. We also are working with the Province to ensure their two appointees are there, and that process is taking a little bit longer than we anticipated, but we are committed to bringing this forward in March to get the new Police Board up and running at that point.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, without naming people’s specific names, who actually attended these training sessions?</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>The only person from the City of Winnipeg that attended the training sessions were myself. Being Chair of Protection and Community Services, I think it does make sense. I believe through our Human Resources Department they had sent a person to videotape it to ensure that there’s a consistency in terms of what is being presented. I was there all weekend representing the City on that behalf, but none of our appointments have been made and once they are, that will be brought to Council. That needs to be voted on before anyone will be able to participate in anything like that.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions for Protection and Community Services? Seeing none we’ll move on to Standing Policy Committee for Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works. There is no report. There are no motions. There’s no consideration of <NOBR>by-laws</NOBR> but we do have a question period. Any questions for Public Works? Councillor Vandal. That's right. We also have Standing Policy Committee on Finance… no report, no motions, no consideration of <NOBR>by-laws</NOBR> and the Chair, unfortunately, is not with us today so I guess we can pass on Finance. And we have one report from the Governance Committee and I'll ask Councillor Steen to sort of stand in for me and move the report.</P>
