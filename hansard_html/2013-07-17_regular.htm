<P class="p6 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Visa. We’d like to thank Councillor Browaty for the treat this morning. I noticed that they’re gingerbread, not shortbread, but we’ll move right along with some announcements and we’d ask Mayor Katz to address a couple of items. Mr. Mayor.</P>
<P class="p8 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to acknowledge the Canadian municipalities that have experienced hardship or devastation in recent days. On June 21st, the City of Calgary experienced an extreme rain event and flooding that caused severe property damage and the largest mandatory evacuation in the city’s history. Over a dozen nearby communities declared states of emergencies and suffered devastating flooding as well. Then on the July 8th, the City of Toronto experienced a rain event that brought much of the city to a standstill. In just a few hours, a month’s worth of rain fell causing flash flooding and widespread power outages. And then of course, the most serious event, on July 6, in <NOBR>Lac-Mégantic,</NOBR> Quebec, a horrible tragedy occurred with a violent explosion resulting in loss of life and widespread destruction. To date, 50 people are missing and presumed dead and the emergency crews continue to work at the disaster site from dawn to dusk. We express our sympathies to everyone experiencing grief or loss as a result of these events. In the months ahead, I’m sure that municipalities across Canada will be learning from these experiences and reviewing emergency preparedness and response plans as necessary, but for today, we wish to state our solidarity with these municipalities and express our sympathies to all those who are struggling to recover from disaster. And Mr. Speaker, I would also encourage of citizens of Winnipeg and my colleagues on Council to come out on Friday afternoon to congratulate one of our favourite sons, Jonathan Toews on his recent Stanley Cup win. We’re all very proud of Jonathan. He’s a very talented hockey player, a role model, a tremendous example of perseverance and leadership and this Friday, at 2:00 p.m., all Winnipeggers are invited to gather at the Jonathan Toews Community Centre in south St. Vital to welcome Jonathan and the Stanley Cup home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p2 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At this point, we’ll adopt the minutes of our previous meeting.</P>

<P class="p4 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>All right. We’ll move into our delegations and we will be suspending some rules here. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p6 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker. I’d like to ask to suspend the rules to hear one other delegation for responsible pet owners, I believe it’s Lynne Scott, from Craig Street Cats.</P>

We’ll notify you when it’s your turn, Ms Scott. All right, the first presenter or presenters are Rob Froese and Bruce Pauls of the Canadian Mennonite University in support of the Item 23. They have ten minutes, gentlemen. Please join us.</P>
<P class="p15 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Rob Froese: </SPAN>No problem, we’ll be less than ten. Wish you all good morning, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Speaker, Councillors. My name is Rob Froese. I’m here representing the Canadian Mennonite University. With me today is Bruce Pauls, who works for the architectural design firm FT3. FT3 is CMUs lead consultant on our library learning commons and bridge project for which the library portion has just commenced construction this Monday, two days ago. We do thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with you this morning in support of Item 23, of a report on the Standing Policy Committee on Property and Development dated July 2, 2013. As you know, this item deals with encroachment agreement between the Canadian Mennonite University and the City of Winnipeg, for the use of Grant Avenue public right of way in order that we may build a covered walkway over top of Grant Avenue between 500 and 600 Shaftesbury Boulevard. I will speak very briefly about this proposed bridge and what it means to CMU after which I’ll turn over to Bruce who can elaborate a bit on the design details of the bridge and the encroachment application that has got us to this far, that to is the point this far. Canadian Mennonite University was formed, for a bit of information, back to this part the year 2000 by the amalgamation of three schools, Canadian Mennonite Bible College, the Mennonite Brethren Bible College and Menno Simons College. The Canadian Mennonite University is a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. The camps at <NOBR>500-600</NOBR> Shaftesbury has long been in a need of a pedestrian bridge connecting the two sides of our campus. At the time CMU was formed, the present City administration was very supportive of Winnipeg’s third university and recommended to us to go to pedestrian bridge across Grant for the safety of the students and staff. Safety and accessibility are two key factors in the need to build this bridge. CMU has had numerous students over the years with physical disabilities, some that require them to use a wheelchair. A few of these students have harrowing stories of trying to cross Grant at the lights at the intersection of Grant and Shaftesbury. Traffic coming from the west down Grant approaches this intersection quite fast as they’re permitted to drive 70 kilometres per hour up until the school or just prior to the school, I should say. Some of this traffic does turn south onto Shaftesbury and they do enter this corner surprisingly fast at times. We have two documented instances where students have been struck by vehicles while crossing Grant at the lights. Neither were life threatening even though ambulances were called out but both were serious enough to warrant real concern. Both incidences occurred as eastbound traffic traveling down Grant was turning south down Shaftesbury. Students with disabilities have also reported that the time permitted across Grant by the walk signals that are present, is not long enough to cross Grant safely and in winter, it becomes an even more dangerous crossing. Last year alone, we had six students with disabilities that for them crossing Grant was not easy. Based on the student enrollment and classroom locations, we have calculated that during the height of the school year, we can have upwards to 800 or more crossings daily between our north and south campuses. During the spring and summer, and throughout the year, we have many external groups renting our facilities. These groups over the last 12 months have numbered up to about 180 groups. They also need to cross Grant to get to our facilities on either side as we have a kitchen and food facility on the south side and a lot of the meeting rooms and classrooms are on the north side. In closing on behalf of CMU, I’d like to thank the members of the Standing Policy and the Executive Policy Committees for their assistance and effort in supporting getting us to the stage. This thanks is also extended to City of Winnipeg Plan Examination and their assistance with everything they’ve done thus far to get us to this point. So this time I’ll turn over to Bruce Pauls.</P>
<P class="p16 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Bruce Pauls: </SPAN>Good morning, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Speaker, Councillors. Rob has already answered the question of why the bridge is necessary and I’ll just anticipate a possible question, that being why a bridge, why not a tunnel. I’ll assure you that a number of very intelligent and talented people have investigated that option and with the number of public services that are buried beneath Grant Avenue that just was not seen as a feasible option. Another question might be why not move the building, locate the building closer to Shaftesbury and make use of that controlled intersection. I do want to explain that that site at 500 Shaftesbury, that’s the former school for the deaf, has a number of certain restrictions imposed by Heritage Manitoba. I was caught off guard this morning when I learned that we are not allowed to provide visual aids so please bear with me a second, I’ll try to explain why the building is where it is. From the corner of Grant and Shaftesbury, the entire south facade of the former school for the deaf is to be visible, unobstructed. There is also a restriction in place that no building is to occur east of the eastern most extent of that building, so essentially that pushes our building to…it pushes our building north, pardon me, pushes our building west to about mid campus. So that’s how we ended up where we are and that’s why the bridge crosses where it does. CMU sees this project as a means to connect to their neighbourhood, their community. The information commons in the library building, the café and the bookstore are all public amenities and CMU hopes to attract some of their neighbours in that way. I want to also reiterate the news of the expansion plans were circulated, published and circulated in the neighbourhood and CMU hosted a public open house just to showcase the project and to address any questions or concerns that might arise. And I also want to ensure you that all departments at Public Works and Planning Property and Development have been consulted. They have approved and we’re thankful for that. This project is the culmination of a lot of hard work and a lengthy design process. We’re all looking forward to seeing it completed and I echo Rob’s gratitude to everyone at the City of Winnipeg who’s helping CMU make it a reality. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, gentlemen. Do we have any questions? We have no one on the opposite side of this. Mayor Katz.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>More of a comment, Mr. Speaker, but I know that several years ago, I met with representatives of the CMU and this was their goal, their dream about whatever the case may be, the connectivity, it’s not a new issue, it’s an old issue. And I just want to commend you for going through the proper channels; doing everything properly and making sure that all students at CMU are safe. It’s a very, very good project, there’s no question about it and we do the same thing in our downtown trying to get connectivity and we know winters are about, the safety is a prime example. So thank you for, shall we say pursuing your dream and your goal and making it happen? No further comments or questions? Councillor Smith. No? Okay. All right, thank you gentlemen, we appreciate you attending today. All right, our next item…and the delegation is Louise May on behalf of the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association in support of Item 3. Ms May. Bill McDonald will follow and then we’ll have another item, you have ten minutes.</P>
<P class="p21 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Louise May: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mayor, Councillors, good morning. I’d like to request a postponement of the vote on the Responsible Pet <NOBR>By-Law</NOBR> today to allow adequate time to ensure the inclusion of backyard chickens. We make this request on the following points. One, the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association was not consulted as promised despite numerous attempts by WUCA to obtain a meeting with Animal Services. This <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> has been fast tracked to today when we had believed that it would be scheduled for September and as many of you know Winnipeg chicken owners are likely still recovering from Folk Fest. Two, the provincial veterinarian through MAFRI was not adequately consulted despite request by WUCA to the EPC to obtain a letter of support confirming two following critical points which have been agreed upon in working discussions. A, that the administration of the data base of small flocks would be managed by the Province through the existing premise identification program and B, that the provincial veterinarian’s office would advise and approve an education in licensing program to be prepared in administrative by the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association. Three, we request that Appendix H be removed from the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> The unsubstantiated claims by the Winnipeg Humane Society “that” and I quote, “animal shelters across North America, which are in the jurisdictions that allow urban backyard chickens have witnessed an alarming increase in the numbers of chickens surrendered to shelters.” The opposite is in fact the reported case; the Winnipeg Humane Society has refused to provide references for this claim and has refused adequate discussions with their Farm Animal Welfare Committee. The Animal Services in comparable cities have received relatively few calls. In Minneapolis, out of 12,500 calls, only 50 were chicken related. In Vancouver, out of 5,000 calls, only 20 were chicken related. In Victoria, out of 3,000 calls, only 5 were chicken related. Number four, we also request that Appendix J be removed from the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> in consideration of the recent communication between WUCA and the BCSPCA, and the legalizing of backyard chickens in Vancouver. In a letter dated from May of this year, we received a positive feedback and I will quote, “First off, we commend your group on putting together such a comprehensive and well thought out plan. You have put considerable work into addressing the concerns that the BCSPCA has with backyard chicken production. Your intensions to ensure the welfare of chickens throughout their lives is evident. The City of Vancouver has developed a web page with many resources geared specifically towards raising backyard chickens. Five, that WUCA has committed to upgrade a chicken shelter at a rural farm to manage all unwanted or seeds birds. An unofficial shelter has already been set up and we will be formalizing it this fall whether or not the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> goes through, we will continue with this work. WUCA is committed to work in a positive relationship with Animal Services to ensure that chickens do not pose any strain on operations. Six, many Winnipeg families currently own chickens, many have owned them for many years. There are chickens in every single ward, so each of you represents families with chickens. Seven, the current <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> will not be enforceable and yet may become a tool for a neighbours to unfairly report neighbours with chickens as been the case in recent appealed fines. Eight, the proposed <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> is unfair. Chickens can be far less noisy, smelly, dangerous disease prone than numerous other pets listed. Responsible pet ownership is about the owner, not the type of pet. Nine, pigeons are found in the City of Winnipeg zoning <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> a conditional use provision could be considered for chickens as well. Coops would have to meet some kind of building code and neighbours could be formally consulted. Ten, that an overall food security strategy is needed for the City of Winnipeg and urban agriculture can become a vibrant economic and environmental solution to looming environmental and economic instability. Backyard chickens should be considered in context of, as part of this strategy. It must be grass root based and with the full corporation of both civic and provincial governments. And last point, <NOBR>free-range,</NOBR> healthy chickens produce optimal renewal protein source. They’re easy to keep, they bond well to humans, especially children. They help families focus on their own healthy food commitments. They reduce organic waste from kitchen foods scraps and produce a fast acting manure ideal to supplement the soil nutrients needs of a backyard vegetable garden. They’re economical and to quote a young volunteer who’s been with me at Arora farm for three years, she said recently, “I can’t believe how much I love chickens.” Thank you.</P>

<P class="p25 ft12"><SPAN class="ft11">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Thank you. My name is Bill McDonald and I’m the Chief Executive Officer of the Winnipeg Humane Society. I’d first just like to thank members of the Standing Committee on Protection and Community Services and the members of the EPC for moving the pet <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> forward to today. I’m going to comment on a number of sections. First off, I was very pleased to see the Council accept the concept of a <NOBR>stand-alone</NOBR> spay and neuter clinic, solely for cat spay and neuter operations. It’s something in the Human Society endorses, we’d be pleased to see it move forward and we’d be pleased to see the 50 percent of the cat licensing revenue go towards a <NOBR>stand-alone</NOBR> spaying and neutering clinic. We support the cat licensing concept and one of the big keys is of the 4,000 stray cats at the Winnipeg Humane Society takes in annually, we only return home to their owners nine percent, through <NOBR>micro-chipped</NOBR> or tattoos. Any mechanism to increase that percentage of return to owners would be welcomed by the Humane Society, and I’d also just like to point out that in the new year, 2014, we will be opening our clinic three Saturdays per month to do more spay and neuter operations. I’d also like to comment on chickens. And in the last two weeks, both the National Post and the Globe and Mail have published articles about shelters and chickens and the Globe and Mail, I’m just going to quote, “Raising chickens in your backyard seems like a brilliant plan. You’d have fresh eggs every morning. Kids would chase them around the backyard, except it’s a lot of hard work, cleaning and feeding those animals. So you’d abandon them like hundreds of other people who had grand plans to be an urban farmer. In Minneapolis, south of us, in 2001, 50 chickens were dropped off at animal shelters. Last year, that number rose to more than 500. That’s a lot of chickens and they have to go some place. They’re going to come to Animal Services or the Winnipeg Humane Society. The Humane Society in the United States, Paul Shapiro, who I’ve known for a number of years. He’s a spokesman for their farm animal welfare. “Many areas with legalized hen keeping are experiencing more and more of these birds coming in when they’re no longer wanted”. He’s quoted as speaking to NBC. You get some chicks and they’re very cute, but it’s not a story you can throw them out in the yard and not care for them. At least, 400 to 500 chickens turn up annually at the farm sanctuary headquartered in Watkins Glen, New York that has sanctuaries on two coasts. Their national director said right now there are around 225 chickens waiting for homes, so it’s a problem and we recognize that. I just like to comment also on the reptile portion of the pet <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> The WHS has dealt with a lot of snakes and reptiles in our years of service to the citizens of Winnipeg and EPC and the standing committee heard from Dr. Nancy McQuade, a veterinarian who has handled many reptiles over the years and seen the effects of neglect when individuals have no idea of the care such creatures need. We’ve seen it as well and it’s incredibly sad to have our vets euthanize a lizard, a snake, because somebody didn’t know what they were doing. And I put it to you that you have a responsibility to ensure animal welfare in our city. You have a responsibility to keep our citizens safe and put in place community standards applicable to all and just recently, slithering snakes fill city suite, it was discovered that the one snake that got out got through the sewer system and came up in the toilet of the bathroom of a gentleman. Another apartment in the building had more than 50 snakes in it. My experience as CEO of the Humane Society is that the average citizen of Winnipeg does not want to have neighbours with an unknown type and specially quantity of snakes, so this <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that is proposed to similar to other jurisdictions, example being Ottawa and it should be implemented. Now, the Winnipeg Humane Society has been against circuses for decades and we’re delighted to have this clause in the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> We’re opposed to using wilder, exotic animals in the traveling shows because of the stress, both physical and social psychological deprivations the animals suffer. The continual caging and travels that these animals are subjected to is simply not acceptable to a caring and compassionate public. Vicky Burns spoke about this to Council in 2001 and finally we’re back at it today. Couple more minutes? I would just like to say a couple quotes then in regards to circuses. This is one of the principles of the Cirque du Soleil, Pierre Parisian, “We will never have animals in our shows. They are animals, not performers.” And I’ll close in saying this, Ruth Harrison, the author of Animal Machines, “In fact, if one person is unkind to an animal, it is considered to be cruelty, but where a lot of people are unkind to animals, especially in the name of commerce, the cruelty is condoned and once large sums of money are at stake, cruelty will be defended to the last by otherwise intelligent people.” Thank you very much.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Smith. Do you have a question? Councillor Orlikow too?</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Bill, can you tell us how many cats were euthanized by the Humane Society in 2012?</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Yes. We took in 5,805 cats in 2012, 4,000 of those would be what would be considered strays, and of the total, we euthanized approximately 2,500, 2,500 cats.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>The other…a week ago, you told before the Committee of EPC, you mentioned the articles in the Post on chickens, and I asked you to forward it to me. I still have not received it. I hope that will be soon.</P>

<P class="p18 ft1">July 17, 2013</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thanks, Bill. Can you give me an idea… one stat that you mentioned…just curious for sure, is that of the number of cats that you receive with the microchips or tattoos, you are only able to return 9 percent back. Can you explain what, I guess someone has actually tattooed and done all that work, they obviously…somebody owns that cat.</P>
<P class="p29 ft1">Bill McDonald: <SPAN class="ft2">Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Why is it so low, return rate?</P>
<P class="p30 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Cats to be micro chipped or tattooed, it’s a choice of the owner and a tattoo can only be done on a cat when it’s knocked out. So the tattoo ratio is fairly low with cats because if you don’t get your cats spayed or neutered, when is the opportunity to get that tattoo done unless you’re purposely knock the cat out? Microchip is a little easier. I could do a microchip, you don’t have to be trained very heavily to do microchips. So with the licensing concept, by comparison and we admire the Calgary model, many of you have heard of the Calgary model. Calgary returns home to their owners 52 percent of their cats. We’re returning 9 percent. By comparison with the number of dogs we receive at the Humane Society, we return home 30 percent, so if I could get the cat returned home percentage tripled to compare with dogs, I would be just delighted. It would be like 1,500 cats a year going home, not staying at the shelter.</P>
<P class="p31 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Just to follow up and excuse my ignorance, so you’re telling me a lot of cats, people own cats from either they go to the store, Humane Society, whatever, they don’t have microchips or tattoos.</P>
<P class="p32 ft1">Bill McDonald: <SPAN class="ft2">Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>So that’s why they’re not going to be returned because we just don’t know whose cat they are, so unless they call and say “I lost Joey the Tabby”…</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Exactly. When I talk Councillor about the 4,000 stray cats, we know they’re not roaming free unknown cats, we know hundreds, if not thousands of them are owned cats that have got out their house, got lost, can’t find their way home and don’t have any identification and we have people coming through the shelter every single day looking through the 265 kennels for their cat and no, a tabby cat is a tabby cat. You have to come and look.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>I wanted to give you the opportunity to talk a bit more about the animal welfare aspects of the circus related portions of the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> I suspect we’re going to hear and we’ve heard a lot about Charter issues and freedom of expression to perform with circus animals and legal cases from Ontario. To my read, a lot of those Ontario cases, the reason behind passing the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> with related to crowd safety, not so much at least my view, the reason why we’re doing this. I think we’re looking at animal welfare. I want to have it on the record that that information is before us, you’re an expert in the animal area. I don’t want your legal opinion, I’d like you to tell us some more though about animal welfare concerns as they relate to these circus animals.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Councillor. I just start out. In 1965, there was a major commission report released and it was done, and it was the very first one in the world, in fact, to review the welfare of farm animals in intensive confinement systems and it was called the Brambell Commission, and what came out of that commission was now commonly referred to as the five freedoms and they’re very basic but they are significant. Number one, freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition. Two, freedom from discomfort. Three, freedom from pain, injury and disease. Four, and this is a critical one, freedom to express normal behavior. And five, freedom from fear and distress. I would argue that circus animals being wild animals are not allowed that fourth freedom to express normal behaviour. Traveling in trailers for 8, 9, 10 even 1 month of the year is not normal behaviour for a wild animal. So they are in effect, being used in entertainment for profit and it is wrong and I would argue that to express normal behaviours, circus animals, it’s so lacking that what they go through borders on abuse and Mr. Solheim who’s here today from TZ Productions, after the last EPC meetings said in the Winnipeg Free Press, he told reporters that the Charter decisions that you mentioned Councillor were based on the rights of performers to work with exotic animals were being violated. I would argue the exact opposite of that. The animals’ rights are being violated by being forced to perform and you have every right to bring in this <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> and ban circuses in Winnipeg. The Winnipeg Charter has three different sections that allows you to do this and I would argue that you’re doing nothing new. It was just announced on July 12 that Belgium, the country, has banned circuses, it’s the fifth European country to do so. So you’re not reinventing the wheel, you’re just getting into the modern age.</P>

<P class="p37 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Bill, thank you very much for being here today. This is regarding chickens and I know you were present at EPC a week ago. When…there was a young mother who was doing home schooling and she made a very passionate plea and I can tell you that in my opinion, there was some Councillors who were rather understanding of that and maybe trying to find some room to maneuver and you may not be aware of the fact but there are some Councillors who have…will be putting forward a motion, as you know schools can have chickens under the Education Act and trying to change the definitions of a school to mean someone who does home schooling so that particular situation would be permissible under the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> Can you share with us your thoughts on that per se?</P>
<P class="p38 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Certainly, Mr. Mayor. Thank you for the question. First off, the Winnipeg Humane Society took in 8,500 animals last year. When you add in the Darcy’s ARC, the Winnipeg Pet Rescue, Craig Street Cats and other rescue shelters, this city is probably dealing with 12,000 to 13,000 animals. My Board of Directors has tasked me with getting our intake numbers down, not up, and I would argue that any more animals coming into the Humane Society is too many more animals, so Mr. Mayor, the answer to that question is gates get left open, people do things by accident. These flocks can get out on to the streets of Winnipeg. Who’s going to be called to pick them up and humanely house them and get them back to the proper owners when you don’t know where they’ve come from and things like that. What if there’s a house fire? Right now Animal Services is on call to assist Fire and Police Services in the middle of the night with animals in house fires. Both our facilities are not equipped to handle chickens. I would argue that WUCA is probably not going to be very much willing to be called out at 3:00 in the morning on a winter night to take chickens somewhere.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes. Mr. McDonald, of all those animals collected, there are a number of chickens actually that exist in this city illegally, but they do exist. How many of those thousands of animals were chickens?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>In say, 2012, Councillor?</P>
<P class="p24 ft1">Councillor Eadie: <SPAN class="ft2">Sure.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Probably two. We have more wildlife than anything else.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Of those two chickens, where did they come from? Were they in the city or were they from agricultural lands?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Found wandering the streets.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions for Mr. McDonald? Seeing none.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Bill McDonald: </SPAN>Thank you, Councillor.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks, Bill. Now, Mr. Larry Solheim of…followed by James Webb, Elizabeth Labelle and Lynne Scott. Mr. Solheim is in opposition to Item 3 and will have ten minutes.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Larry Solheim: </SPAN>I do have some hard copies for some materials. I know that all of you have received these materials by <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> but because of the late nature of submitting them, I think you may want to look at some of the materials.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Sir, you have a timer right here. You can keep an eye on your presentation for ten minutes.</P>
<P class="p40 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Larry Solheim: </SPAN>Members of the Council, Mayor Katz. Thank you for allowing me once again to come and speak. This is a very important issue to our community and to families in Winnipeg that enjoy animal circuses. I’m the General Manager of TZ Productions, a family owned circus company. They’re celebrating their 250th year producing circuses worldwide for families. We’re also the producer of the Royal Canadian Circus for our 20 years in Winnipeg. As a collective effort, I’m representing TZ Productions, Cirque Mondo, Feld Entertainment which is Ringling Brothers, the Outdoor Amusement Business Association, the Circus Fans Associations of America or North America, the researchers and veterinary personnel who work with our circuses to ensure that the animals are happy and healthy and the circus animal loving families in Winnipeg who deserve a choice. We all know this is a very, very emotional issue, not only for people on the other side of the platform but also for us, the ones who work with these animals and ensure their welfare. We have some opposition not to the bill, not to the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> entirely in fact we commend the city for the majority of the by- law, but we do have a concern with exotic animal ban section. First of all, banning circuses performing with animals is not really a responsible pet ownership issue. It has nothing to with pet ownership, it’s a different situation, and so we feel</P>

The cities are attempting to hold circuses to…with animals to a higher standard public safety than others public events like sporting events. It’s a very important issue and then based on recent court decisions, the city could be infringing on certain rights provided under Canada’s Charters of Rights and Freedoms. Normally, when dealing with issues like this, there’s three areas of concerns. There’s animal welfare public safety and then the right of passing such legislation. With the animal welfare, the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> seems to have no issues with animals that are in captivities since they’re exemptions for zoos, universities and research facilities. Also the concerns brought forth by the sponsors of the legislation seem to center on transportation, temporary housing conditions and behavioural conditioning, which they see are unique to circuses, but they’re truly not. The claims brought forth by our opponents that the animals are forced to perform unnatural acts is simply false. Everything that our animals perform, any act that they perform in our shows stems from a natural behaviour, absolutely. I will show you photo evidence if you require. Then the claims of abusive train techniques are also false. If they were true, our veterinarians and the frequent unannounced inspections would certainly show evidence of that. It does not exist in our operations. In relationship to public safety, in circuses with animals had significantly lower risk spectators than do other public events such as hockey, baseball or even children playing on playgrounds. The companies who insure the circuses with animals do not even consider it a high risk event. On the rights and freedoms issue, the proposed <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> would infringe on the rights of artistic expression, which has been cited in three Ontario Superior Court decisions, all of which our company and the group that I’m representing we’re part of. It’s also unfair to pass a <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> which will in fact ban the citizens of Winnipeg, the freedom of choice to see these magnificent animals in a up close environment that no book or video can duplicate. I’d like to talk about some of the materials that you’ve been provided as evidence or that were assessed in the process of this <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> First of all, no circus productions that I know of, especially the ones that do work in Winnipeg, were not consulted for any evidence or any opinion in the early stage of this. If somebody was going to do a real look at the situation, I think they would have to have information from both sides. The accusations of detrimental conditions are simply that, just accusations. The major circuses that have been performing in Winnipeg for many years have been full compliance with no charges laid against them. The Khartoum Shriners, which we have several representatives in the gallery today, have been sponsoring the Shrine Circus in Winnipeg for seventy years without incidents, most of those years they’ve had exotic animals. They’re even proactive by employing independent veterinarians to witness and evaluate the animal care, which was being provided at the circus. I’ve been personally involved with the general management and animal regulatory compliance for TZ Productions, the producer of the Royal Canadian Circus, for 24 years. I’ve always been…we’ve always complied with requests for the local provincial and federal agencies including inspections by the Humane Society and evaluations by independent veterinarians as required by the Province of Manitoba. I know of no recorded incidents of charges being laid against the major circuses in Winnipeg, which would indicate that the animal care was sufficient. The most significant research has been done, has not considered, has not been considered, most likely because it does not support some of the outrageous claims that our opposition brings to the table. It also appears that the circus opinions and recommendations of groups such as Canadian Federation of Humane Societies and Humane Society of the United States have been considered as evidence even though they’re neither a regulatory agency or an animal welfare organization. Both are primarily political or industrial lobbyists who actually create much of the misinformation that’s found on the internet. Relating to the case law, in recent years, there’s three major municipalities who banned or attempted to ban circus productions from performing with animals and they’ve been challenged in Canadian courts, Toronto, Windsor and Newmarket. All three cases cited a protected right to perform with animals of any type under Canada’s Charter Rights and Freedoms. I must add that that was not the primary goal and the primary purpose of challenging the ban. It was based on the fact they’re using misleading information and the claims just could not be proven and that’s why they lost. The issue of the Charter portion was actually thrown in by the judge as just another criteria that they felt was important place in the decision. The judge identified the materials which were provided by the animal rights groups in the decision listed as largely unverified, misleading and inflammatory. Additionally, the affidavit of anthropologist, Jennifer Johnson identified the close relationship and bond between the circus animals and trainers and the affidavit of Mr. Stan proved that there was no significant risk to the public due to circus animals. It’s a fact that the municipalities not only have to bear the cost of the defense but they also were required to pay the plaintiffs hundreds of thousands of dollars in court cost. That was unnecessary. If the communities would’ve done their due diligence and research the facts on both sides, they would’ve clearly seen that the information was initially presented to them was not true. It’s important to note that there had been no major Canadian cities who attempted to pass an exotic animal ban since those three consecutive decisions until now. Also noteworthy is a recent decision in the ASPCA versus Feld Entertainment. Feld was awarded 9.3 million dollars as a settlement for over decade worth of manufactured litigation and false claims. Feld has also filed a suit against the HSUS, which was noted in the materials provided to Council, for litigation abuse and racketeering and that’s still in the courts. I’ve presented in the packages several letters from our company, from Feld Entertainment, the Outdoor Amusement Business Association, some distinguished veterinarians such as Dr. Daniel Schmidt, Dr. Mark Wilson and Dr. Ted Friend, all three doctors are agreeing and that they deal with these animals on daily basis that in a</P>

<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>We’re going to extend you but if you start to wrap up that would be appreciated.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Larry Solheim: </SPAN>You’ve also received letters from various members of the circus fans association and a letter from the Khartoum Shriners who have corrected a statement that was made by one of their representatives and they do support animals and circuses whether they choose to use them in their productions or not. Our recommendation really for Council is to consider imposing a permit process similar to other progressive cities like Sacramento, Minneapolis, Windsor, Ottawa. I’ve even got a copy of one of the <NOBR>by-laws</NOBR> which is very well written from Ottawa if you’d like to see that. Basically, these operations instead of banning, they’re ensuring that the operators and the animals that are coming to the community are healthy and well serviced and that the companies are sufficient, they have some sufficient resources and do their due diligence to ensure the animal welfare financially. In summary, I would not be here today if I didn’t know in my heart that these animals were happy and healthy, that their social needs are being met and that they receive the respect that they deserve. I’d really encourage you to read the letter from Dr. Ted Friend and I’ve got copies of some of his research; he’s done ten important studies about the transportation which is one of the accusations, the housing, the behaviours that are being claimed. Very good material, solid evidence that’s used worldwide and he is the leading expert and the leading authority and research from Texas A&U University and the research is sponsored by the USDA. We feel that the Council’s been presented with some weak evidence and even lies from people who often say whatever it takes to achieve their goal. As we all know there are some bad people in the world, people who shouldn’t think twice or who wouldn’t think twice of hurting others or animals but not everyone’s like that. One minute? Okay. Fortunately, most people work with their animals as we do, very responsibly. Please don't fall prey to this type of moral extortion. Look to the facts and do what’s fair and proper. Over 30,000 happy circus goers per year in Winnipeg alone choose to come back because they know the truth, they see the animals. I’d like to make one final comment about the five freedoms. If we're exempting research laboratories, I believe that some of those freedoms would probably not be achieved such as pain, confinement, items like that. And that is exempt in the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> Plus, Cirque du Soleil has worked with animals.

<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, first of all, thank you for your presentation for coming out to Executive Policy Committee as well as Protection and Community Services. The thing that I’m somewhat interested in is in terms of the special permit piece that you are referring to and we’ve got some information late, so the question I have for you is what other Canadian…and I know you mentioned a few, but what other Canadian jurisdictions have this special permit that you are referring to? How did that work in other jurisdictions?</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Larry Solheim: </SPAN>Well, the most significant ones that we operate under that would be similar to the type of <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that we would ask for here are Windsor and in Ottawa. Quebec has a separate permit that's applied for, however, it's a much lower level of compliance. We literally have to supply about 50 pages of information to the permits in Windsor and Ottawa, which includes health certificates for the animals, inspection reports from the SPCA, information about security, housing, schedules when we're going to be there, insurance, everything that you need to put on an event and ensure that safety is covered as well as animal welfare plus they have required inspections by the Humane Society when we're in those communities.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions for Mr. Solheim? Seeing none, thank you, sir. We appreciate your attending today. We'll invite James Webb and Elizabeth Labelle. You have five minutes, sir.</P>

I’m here with my colleague, Elizabeth Labelle to speak on behalf of our advocacy group, citizens helping to end the cat crisis. Our group was created out of public concern for the cats in Winnipeg affected by the cat overpopulation crisis. We are disappointed to see that after all of these meetings and discussions there’s still nothing specific and basically no plan other than a vague reference to expanding spaying and neutering in the city. In our discussions with several City Councillors as well as with Mr. Leland Gordon, Chief Operating Officer of Animal Services, we have come to realize that there is a political ideology at work here and the prevailing attitude seems to be that it is up to the private sector to solve this horrendous cat overpopulation crisis. Mr. Gordon has suggested more</P>

<P class="p45 ft4">than once that perhaps a wealthy philanthropist will step forward. This fairy tale approach is not the way to solve this problem. Research has shown that the only solution is a highly efficient, high volume, low cost spay and neuter clinic open to all members of the public regardless of income level. Thanks to the efforts of an American <NOBR>non-profit</NOBR> organization called Humane Alliance, this new concept of a highly efficient, high volume, low cost spay and neuter clinic is spreading across North America and is now making inroads into Canada with three such clinics in Ontario, soon to be four. Many other groups in both the USA and Canada are currently involved in discussions with the Humane Alliance Organization. Humane Alliance does not own these clinics nor do they operate them. They serve to train and mentor the organization setting up the clinic and they assist with the startup procedure. I have lived in Winnipeg all my life and I have personally been concerned about this animal overpopulation issue for decades, always hoping for a positive change when all the while the situation has been growing steadily worse instead of better. I recall that back in the 1980s, it was reported that the Winnipeg Humane Society was ending the lives of 5,000 to 6,000 cats per year as well as 2,000 to 3,000 dogs. These days, the dog overpopulation is more or less manageable but even with the emergence of a multitude of no kill shelter is now sharing the burden, the cat overpopulation still remains wildly out of control with 2,500 healthy but unfortunate felines still having their lives ended at the Winnipeg Humane Society in 2012 alone. Decades ago, there were few options available in dealing with an animal overpopulation situation and consequently there was a reluctant acceptance among the general public that this policy of euthanasia was an unfortunate but necessary reality. But now in these days we know different and we see a growing movement across North America towards the establishment of highly efficient, high volume, low cost spay and neuter clinics which are proven to be effective and successful in reducing animal overpopulation levels. A little research will reveal that this is an issue which is gaining momentum across North America and those politicians who do not embrace a modern day solution will soon find themselves on the wrong side of history.</P>
<P class="p30 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Elizabeth Labelle: </SPAN>We would also like to stress as we have done so in previous speeches that there is a high cost to taxpayers associated with our city’s cat and dog overpopulation. That cost in the past ten years alone has been in the millions and will continue to rise unless there is affordable, high volume, low cost spay and neutering accessible to the public regardless of income level. Citizens are becoming aware of the facts surrounding this issue as the cost to taxpayers rises. The public will …you, their elected officials to take responsibility. At the July 4th meeting of the Standing Policy Committee on Protection and Community Services, the proposed cat licensing program was amended and now states that 50 percent of funds from cat licences be given to Leland Gordon, the Chief Operating Officer of Animal Services to best views to his discretion for spay and neutering. As we have already pointed out, this is not a proactive plan. In fact, this is not a plan at all. The public would expect a proven effective solution to cat overpopulation be written into the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> At previous meetings, our proposed solution to cat overpopulation has received praise from Councillors and His Worship Mayor Katz. At the July 4th meeting of the Standing Policy Committee, the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> was deemed, the original <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> was deemed, too prescriptive and would not allow for future possibilities such as the opening of a high volume spay and neuter clinic in the future, therefore I would propose that this be clearly written into the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> Someone has to do this. The Winnipeg Humane Society, Animal Services the rest suggested by some Councillors, a <NOBR>non-profit,</NOBR> having this written in the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> would pave the way for <NOBR>non-profit</NOBR> group to set up a clinic as well in the city. Could you make one remark? Okay, thank you.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">James Webb: </SPAN>Okay, thank you. Regarding the issue of cat licensing, we would like to commend Councillor Fielding for his stand on the issue and for his courage in opposing it obviously against the wishes of his fellow Councillors and of animal services as well. At the July 4th meeting of the Standing Policy Committee on Protection and Community Services, Councillor Fielding made a statement to the effect that he did not see a correlation between cat licensing and spaying and neutering. He is of course exactly right. There is none. Spaying and neutering is an issue unto itself and another 83,000 in the hands of the private sector will have no significant effect in reducing this critical cat overpopulation crisis. Therefore, in that case, the status quo will remain. Thousands of mostly healthy animals will continue to be put to death each and every year and Winnipeg will continue to be seen as a high kill city in the eyes of the nation and the eyes of the world. And the fact that we here in Winnipeg are unwilling to move on a real solution in order to stop these unfortunate animals from coming through the doors of these shelters for which they never leave alive is truly shameful. In closing, I would like everyone assembled here today to realize that that animal on the table at the Winnipeg Humane Society, receiving a lethal injection, that animal values his or her life just as much as you do yours.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Elizabeth Labelle: </SPAN>And that concludes our presentation.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding has a question.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you very much. Question I haven't asked at Standing Policy and also Executive Policy and I’ll ask again. With the proposal that’s before us, obviously we know that there’s some up front you know capital costs that are there although you can get creative with the city through a facility or what have you, how many procedures would you have to have for a facility like this to be part of?</P>

<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Right, so there’s 85, just the second question. Do I get three questions? I should know that by now, been here for seven years. The question I have for you, with the financial modeling that we have that was based on the administrative you know suggested numbers of what we're going to have, based on $40 and I think that's what the Humane Society says it costs to deliver the service. You know it should generate about 2,000 new procedures spaying and neutering that’s going to happen here. So are you aware that the proposal you are bringing forward would have four times as much the amount of procedures happening in the city of Winnipeg as was before us in terms of the Council initiative before us?</P>

<P class="p34 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thank you. Thank you for your presentation. And again, I’m still amazed so, working my way through this as we hear presentations go through, so I do appreciate your comments today. One thing I want to ask you though is about the licensing. I know we could talk about the spay and neutering and responsible pet owners pay for that, should it be done by the City or not, but my question is regarding the returning of cats with the licensing, the actual licence part. So if you can just pull the spay and neutering part out of it. I was shocked to hear that the return rate is nine percent. This theoretically will increase that return rate to I think we heard upwards of 30 percent, thousand or plus cats. Do you have any comments on that?</P>
<P class="p43 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Elizabeth Labelle: </SPAN>Yes, we do. As far as the institution of cat licensing that will not guarantee that. The higher rate in Calgary and other cities, cat licensing just wasn't on its own. That was part of a program. I mean they had in Calgary, they had Animal Services officers going around, they have lap tops in their car, I mean, that the cat is picked up or whatever and is brought right to the person and not to a shelter. You know, so just the fact that cat licensing is going to be instituted here in the city does not mean that the return rate will necessarily be any higher.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">James Webb: </SPAN>And also just because there’s more cats being returned to their owners, that’s not going to significantly reduce the cat overpopulation crisis, it's high volume spay and neutering accessible to the public, that will do it.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m just looking for a little bit of clarification. When we talk about the Humane Alliance, the concept, which I actually thought was embraced by many elected officials as well as I thought was being supported by both Leland Gordon and Bill McDonald, that was my impression, may not have been yours, that certainly was mine. I got the impression that the whole secret here is to do very inexpensive or what you would call affordable spay and neutering. What would that number be? Is that $10 or $15? What would that number be in your opinion?</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Elizabeth Labelle: </SPAN>You know, that the Humane Alliance consults with you, they have a mentoring program and I mean they wouldn't help the City or anybody start up a clinic unless it was going to be sustainable. What would be the point, right? So as far as the numbers, I mean that depends on your volume, but typically, you know, typically it’s 60, it could be $60, it could be 35, but I mean it’s…so that is considered low cost. You know, it can vary slightly but I mean it is still considered, by far it’s 500, to could be up to 500 to spay a female cat so I mean when you’re looking at you know, $35 to $60, I mean that is affordable. That’s in the affordable range.</P>
<P class="p51 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>So what you are saying to me then, because that kind of surprises me. You are saying the City of Winnipeg, your definition of affordable would be between $35 and $60?</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Elizabeth Labelle: </SPAN>That is the number to have a clinic to be…so it is accessible to all. I know that…you know, the majority of people who can go to their vet probably might think you know, well, what’s…you know, what's 500, 300, you know that type of thing but I mean in order to get the amount of cats and dogs from up north, whatever, done, you know, it has to be you know, within that range. I mean like I said, it varies slightly but you know, it has to be affordable and that's what the…isn’t it the Winnipeg…isn’t it the Federation of…</P>
<P class="p42 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">James Webb: </SPAN>The Canadian Federation of the Humane Society said that the major obstacle is the high cost of veterinary services.</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further questions. Thank you, folks, we appreciate your presentation today. And our last delegation is Lynne Scott from the Craig Street Cats.</P>
<P class="p53 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Lynne Scott: </SPAN>Good morning. I would like to thank Councillor Fielding for asking Council to suspend the rules to allow me to speak today. I have some materials to distribute. There’s two different ones. I am wearing two hats today. I come to you as both as the Executive Director of Craig Street Cats, which is the largest cat specific animal welfare organization in Manitoba and as the president of Pets Alive Winnipeg which is a newly formed <NOBR>non-profit</NOBR> organization, working to bring the no kill equation to this city. As speaking on behalf of Craig Street Cats, we have grave concerns over the cat licensing portion of the draft <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> and I would just like to go through a few of them. Most of this was gone, been gone through at EPC and Standing Committee, however, materials presented at those meetings gave rise to additions to my presentation. It is our position that licensing cats will not achieve what the City hopes to achieve. There are over 100,000 cats on the streets of Winnipeg. We use the term community cats. This incorporates cats that were never owned, that were born feral;cats that were at one time owned and either are lost or abandoned and cats that for one reason or another are allowed to roam by their owners. Fifty percent of the revenue from cat licensing cannot possibly hope to cope with this. If the intended purpose of cat licensing is to address the number of cats on Winnipeg streets and help reduce those numbers, cat licensing is not the way to go. You can't raise enough money to make a significant impact. We were concerned about sending 50 percent of licence fees to the Winnipeg Humane Society for a possible distribution to D’Arcy’s ARC and Winnipeg Pet Rescue Shelter because none of those organizations have existing programs to deal with cats on the street leaving 100 percent of the money from cat licensing with animal services is likewise a grave concern because Animal Services has no programs to deal with cats, period. Leaving the money with an organization that has no capacity to deal with cats would seem silly. At EPC meeting last week, Mr. Gordon was asked to assure committee that no taxpayer funding would be necessary in order to implement or maintain cat licensing. A look at other jurisdictions that have implemented cat licensing would indicate that reality is very much the opposite of this statement. Calgary made a significant investment of public funds before launching its cat licensing program and every penny of cat licence fees go into services for cats and cat owners. Calgary also offers an incentive program to encourage pet owners to license their pets. Toronto tried to run its program on licence fees alone. After eight years they had less than a 10 percent compliance rate and were looking for ways to dismantle the program. They have since invested taxpayer money in a chip truck which is a mobile licence and microchip facility that sells cat and dog licences and offers microchips for a nominal $10 fee. Toronto has also started a loyalty program that offers discounts on merchandise from participating merchants to pet owners with valid licence tags for their pets. It is unknown whether these enhancements have improved compliance because the program is very new. It was hoped that they would help raise cat licensing compliance from under 10 percent to approximately 20 percent over several years. It is…it has been stated that cat licensing would improve return to owner rates. The Winnipeg Humane Society currently has a nine percent return to owner rate for cats entering the shelter. I have to tell you, across North America that is at the higher end of the spectrum, even in jurisdictions that have cat licensing. Regina which has cat licensing currently returns four to five percent of cats to their owners. The fact that Calgary has a higher return rate has more to do with the way the program was implemented than the fact that cats are wearing licences.

<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Lynne Scott: </SPAN>I’m going to switch hats and talk as a board member for Pets Alive Winnipeg and we are offering some creative solutions for Winnipeg's community cats. Winnipeg's community cats are a community problem. Dealing with them will require a <NOBR>community-based</NOBR> solution. Currently, over 100 unowned cats roam our streets, 100,000, sorry, unowned cats roam our streets. Each adult cat will produce three kittens this year. Of those 300,000 kittens, 75 percent</P>

<P class="p56 ft4">will die before they are old enough to reproduce, approximately 10 percent of the survivors will be rescued, the rest, over 65,000 will join the breeding population. Allowing for natural fluctuations in population, the numbers of cats on our streets can double every five years. Trap, neuter, return is the only form of cat population control that has ever been affected in reducing community cat populations. Where systematic TNR is applied, numbers go down dramatically. Craig Street Cats has seen an average population reduction of 70 percent over five years in areas where they have been able to establish systematic colony management programs. These reductions apply even when there is immigration of new cats due to migration from neighbourhood, neighbouring colonies or pet abandonment. Although the stated purpose of cat licensing is to reduce the number of cats on Winnipeg streets, anticipated licence revenue is inadequate for that purpose. In addition, cat licensing unfairly burdens cat owners with responsibility for a community problem. Pets Alive Winnipeg proposes a way to slow the population growth and eventually reverse it. As part of our commitment to bringing the no kill equation to Winnipeg, Pets Alive Winnipeg intends to establish a high volume low cost spay and neuter clinic that will provide…</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Complete your thought and then...</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Lynne Scott: </SPAN>That will provide affordable cat and dog sterilization for pet owners and readily accessible services for community cats. We’re asking Council to help us in this project by making a few small changes to the proposed Responsible Pet Ownership <NOBR>By-Law.</NOBR> We ask that you reject cat licensing as the funding model for community cats spay and neuter programs. Consider a <NOBR>community-based</NOBR> approach to funding services for community cats such as a $1 per household per year assessment on either residential property taxes or residential water bills. This would provide more money than anticipated licence revenues and is unlikely to provoke a negative reaction. If necessary, the amount of the assessment could be temporary raised to $5 per household per year to allow for special circumstances. This model places responsibility for community cats with the entire community where it rightly belongs. Removing pet impediments to TNR from the <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> harbouring is an antiquated concept that places blame for community cats on home owners who simply allow the cats to remain in their yards. It makes criminals of home owners who are actively trying to reduce the number of community cats on our streets. We ask Council to consider also providing concrete help in the form of nominal rental for a centrally located building to become the Pets Alive Winnipeg Clinic and to forgive property taxes for said clinic for the first ten years of operation. We had intended to come before Council with a completed business plan when this item came up in September, however, the fact that it came up two months early meant that we were scrambling to get materials together. I hope you will forgive us for not having solid figures for you. We anticipate that startup costs for our clinic will be between $350,000 and $500,000 if the City provides the building and property tax forgiveness, total cost will be closer to $350,000 although we hope to receive several different grants to help with initial costs. These have not been included in cost calculations as we cannot be certain of receiving these amounts. We are currently pursuing registered charity status and will begin fundraising for this clinic as soon as that has cleared. We hope that we can count on help from Council.</P>

<P class="p63 ft1">Item 1 - Aboriginal Scholarship and Community Service Award Program</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this as many may know, and probably know for well. We have been providing scholarships for <NOBR>post-secondary</NOBR> education for aboriginal people as well as job training. It certainly has been confined to in the Winnipeg School Division. We have had requests from other school divisions contrary to what some may think, it's right across the City of Winnipeg. It’s not just in one area and this would be expanding the program. I believe from the results we've seen, this has been a very positive scenario. As far as the training that has been done within existing departments’ budgets, I certainly hope that Council will be supportive of it and I very much would like to hear from Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p34 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to flag this issue. It's something that I raised. I know Councillor Vandal and I have received correspondence from the Louis Riel School Division back sometime last year. Their concern is that the program was only in the Winnipeg School Division. I’d asked about it here on the floor of Council in December so I just want to commend the Mayor for moving this forward, not costing any additional funding. It’s been from within the million dollars that we set aside in the budget for the aboriginal youth program. So something I’m very pleased to see move forward. I’ll certain be supporting it and it is, as the Mayor says, there are aboriginal students throughout the city, some big numbers in the Louis Riel School Division and certainly I’m very pleased to see this getting expanded out to now serve all the school divisions in the City of Winnipeg.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>To close Mayor Katz.</P>

<P class="p66 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Yes, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to flag this down. Basically being a member of the local Winnipeg Knights of Rizal Chapter, I couldn’t help myself but stand it down and recognize and thank the local chapter for the good work that they’ve done on this and also to thank the developer and the City of Winnipeg for designating Dr. Jose Rizal Way as a street within our city and also to say to…for Lombard North, congratulations on that particular developer for this particular development. It’s a wonderful development, it’s part of a…this small subdivision rezoning is part of a thousand unit development in northwest Winnipeg, Mr. Speaker, the first of a…in a long history of no development happening in Point Douglas, so it's great to see this particular development happening. This is phase one of 600 new units and I just want to say that you know this development is really unique. It’s got lots of sidewalks, there’s a lot of active transportation networks, there’s a commitment to public art and also what really is very important about this to the local chapter is that the developer is going to be establishing a seven and a half foot high bronze plated statue, the corner of Dr. Jose Rizal Way and Old Commonwealth Road. So I just wanted to thank the Mayor, EPC and Council for their support on this.</P>

<P class="p77 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. The…I understand that the…and I appreciate the fact that the Mayor was able to get the matter under way with regards to the 3.8 million in recreation funding that we announced in our budget of this year. That was the monies originally from the water park and then it was divided up amongst the wards - $271,000 per ward, and from what I understand working through our staff and members of Council, the Mayor had a list of what projects members of Council had selected to date. That list has been submitted, I understand, to the Province for their <NOBR>sign-off</NOBR> and for their approval which is great because we need to get this money underway. Is there any idea at this point in terms of when the Premier of the Province will be signing off on those projects, that list that the Mayor sent since the funding is partly theirs but of course it’s been done through the BCI Program, Building Communities Initiative Program, and is there any idea at this point of when the Provincial Government may be coming forward with the <NOBR>sign–off</NOBR> so that we can get these funds well underway in terms of work in our communities?</P>
<P class="p67 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to Councillor Wyatt Mr. Speaker, I can certainly share that I believe it was on Monday, Mr. Speaker, where yours truly signed the agreement identifying all 14 projects. It’s my understanding after reviewing the document that all signatures on behalf of the City of Winnipeg are on that. They are now sent over to the Provincial Government and I would hope that this document would be signed by all the signatories for the Provincial Government so we can start this work. As you know, these projects involve, I think, 14 different wards which have basically identified every single Councillor here except for one Councillor who got something else in lieu of and that would have been Councillor Thomas Steen regarding the community centre, so I would be more than happy to give them a few days Mr. Speaker and then have a <NOBR>follow-up</NOBR> phone call, but right now it has been signed by everybody from the City of Winnipeg. It is sitting with the Provincial Government and I think it’s only reasonable to give them a few days and then I’d be happy to make a <NOBR>follow-up</NOBR> phone call.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p30 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Yeah, the next question is I understand from talking to one of the community groups in my ward that…actually we were at the…it was announced at the Buhler Recreation Park, $200,000 in terms of the Transcona Ward to invest into creating winter activity amenities at the Buhler Recreation Park. You were in attendance there with the President of the Buhler Recreation Park, Tom Thompson. The Board of Directors were very supportive of the project. I understand now that the MLA for the area, the Speaker of the House, Daryl Reid, has contacted the Buhler Recreation Park and is in opposition to the spending in this area. Would you be prepared to do a <NOBR>follow-up</NOBR> letter to the Premier in the event we have to move the funds because of the opposition to other worthy projects in the community because of the opposition by the local MLA to the spending in this area?</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>All politics are local. Mayor Katz.</P>
<P class="p34 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I can only say this – that I have heard grumblings to that effect. I have not had anyone from the Province communicate directly with me. If what has…but if the proponent being Buhler Park has already been in contact with the MLA and that is accurate, I think it would be incumbent upon us, number one, to determine...I’d like to know why. That’s first of all. I mean, these are all good projects throughout the City, so I personally would like to know why and if there are valid reasons, it certainly makes sense, assuming both the Province and the City local Councillor can agree, of identifying another project if that project is not going to go forward. That would be the astute thing to do, absolutely.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>More of an “are you aware” question, but you’re absolutely correct. It’s a tremendous project. It’s unfortunate that the funding may have to be moved. Are you aware that as of this morning, I spoke with the MLA for Radisson, who is the neighbouring MLA, Mr. Bidhu Jha, Mr. Reid is in opposition. He is more than happy to see the funds invested in playgrounds in the Transcona Ward in the Radisson constituency. Are you aware of that fact and that we may have to, unfortunately, move funds because of the opposition of one MLA, the Speaker of the House, to a very worthy project?</P>
<P class="p78 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, through you to Councillor Wyatt I certainly am aware of that as of right now, that’s for sure.</P>

<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Sharma.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I understand the Mayor was on CJOB this week answering a question on the status of the opening of the new restaurant at Kildonan Park. I’m certainly getting a lot of questions. There seems to be some delays so I’m wondering if you could share those details with us.</P>
<P class="p29 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Through you to Councillor Sharma, that is correct. I did have a member of the public, actually I believe was yesterday morning on ‘OB, call and ask me about that and we were able to get through the administration. What has been determined, the goal for the Peguis Pavilion, the work that’s being done, was July 1. Obviously that has not become reality and we have been told right now, unfortunately, that it will be the first week of September. I think we all want to see that project happen as quickly as possible. There have been a few challenges and now that is what the department is telling us. It will be finished the first week of September. I can tell you that from the public’s point of view, that is a park that gets a great deal of use. As you know the City of Winnipeg has invested significant money in there. I think it’s reaping great rewards from the public as far as the pool, the spray pad, the play area. This certainly is extremely integral. I’m sure everybody on the floor of Council will recall that just recently the City of Winnipeg did award a contract to a restaurateur to operate the restaurant there, so we certainly hope that will happen as soon as possible, but right now the first week of September is the projected date.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Follow up? Okay. Councillor Pagtakhan.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Yes, thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Through you to the Mayor, the Arlington Bridge, Mr. Speaker, is currently closed for repairs since Monday of this week until the end of August of this year and this is a bridge that’s over 100 years old Mr. Speaker. It’s a <NOBR>well-known</NOBR> bridge within our City and it sees on any given day 15,000 vehicles travelling north and south on the bridge. Mr. Speaker, through you to the Mayor, does the Mayor feel that the Arlington Street Bridge is a key route for Winnipeggers?</P>
<P class="p79 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p80 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I know I may have to defer that to Councillor Vandal, the Chair. No of course not. First of all Mr. Speaker, as Councillor Pagtakhan is aware of, City staff do inspections on a regular basis. There is deck work being done right now on that bridge to make sure that it continues to be safe so people can use it on a regular basis. It is approximately a <NOBR>six-week</NOBR> closure which I think is a significant inconvenience, no question about it, but I think we all appreciate the value of safety. As far as my opinion of that being a valuable access to the north end, it certainly is for me Mr. Speaker. I use it on a regular basis. By the same token, I could probably list you a hundred priorities of infrastructure such as that that should be addressed, and that certainly is definitely one of them, and when addressing those types of projects, as you know it’s always been my belief that as opposed to a political decision, I let the experts decide what the priorities are and where those scarce resources go to, but there is no doubt in my mind that the Arlington Bridge is something that will have to be addressed in the very near future. We’ve been doing this for quite a while and you know, it probably is getting close to the time of making a good astute decision. With every decision comes the scenario: where do we find the money, so of course we have to find that balance. But yes, I do believe that it’s an important route. Absolutely.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p30 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Yes, thank you Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the Mayor for his response to the question. I appreciate that. Absolutely, I concur with the Mayor’s comments relative to the safety and that this bridge is certainly needing the repairs that it needs and it’s getting the love that it needs. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to ask to the Mayor a bit of a pointed question basically. When the time comes, the Mayor alluded to the fact that we will have to be dealing with the Arlington Street Bridge in the very near future. We all know that there is an engineering report out there that talks about the year 2020 being a critical year with respect to a decision or something happening at the Arlington Street Bridge, perhaps a decommissioning. Is the Mayor committed to ensuring that monies are budgeted in the Capital Budget for the construction of a new Arlington Street Bridge?</P>
<P class="p64 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I guess the first scenario is, Mr. Speaker, first of all I have said that I believe that’s an important route, so I think, you know, money would have to be committed. By the same token I’m sure every Councillor in this Chamber probably has a project similar to that which I think is why we’ve been trying to identify a source of revenue. I’m not going to get into the whole scenario of, you know, we’re looking for one point of the existing PST or potentially a rebate on the PST or getting something from vehicle registration. We’ve gone through all different scenarios with the Provincial</P>

Again thanks to the Mayor for his comments on that and I just wanted to say that, you know, this Council passed a new initiative, the local…pardon me, the Regional Street Reserve and I’m glad that we’ve done that. Is the Mayor aware that Arlington Street between Portage Avenue and Inkster is classified by the City of Winnipeg as a regional street?</P>
<P class="p35 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Yes he is Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. The tragedy that occurred in Quebec last week, two weeks ago, that saw many lives lost due to a rail accident involving combustible materials which exploded and created one of the worst rail related tragedies a community could face. Could the Mayor please tell us, given that Winnipeg is also a rail based city with rail lines running through its core through nearly every end of this city, what steps has he taken for the citizens of Winnipeg whom he represents, to mitigate the levels of risk. Has he had any discussions with any of the rail lines, and I’m asking this on the one year approximate anniversary of when the St. Boniface explosion occurred and I’d like to know what preventative measures is he considering?</P>
<P class="p24 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I would hope you would give Councillor Havixbeck the opportunity to clarify exactly what she means by that. Is she referring to moving the rails or exactly what it is she is asking and I’d be happy to address the answer?</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Specifically the combustible materials. I believe I mentioned that in my question and how many, what is the magnitude of what the rails are moving.</P>
<P class="p51 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, for the record I would hope that all members of Council would know that we do have an EMO, Mr. Randy Hull. I can tell you that on a regular basis, we are doing basically, shall we call, “dress rehearsals” in case an emergency would ever take place and trying to address all the potential issues of what could happen, and according to Mr. Hull, who basically acts on behalf of the City, and as you know in other scenarios, has shown that more than capable. Has also shown how all the departments, and I’m referring to every department including other levels of government, work together. That, God willing, something of that ilk should never happen. That we will be as prepared as you possibly can be. You can never be one hundred percent prepared for the unknown, but we do this on a regular basis. We work with the Fire Department, we do drills at the airport, we continue to address scenarios where there is a potential of this. This is being done on a regular basis. We here, sitting on the floor of Council, may not be aware of what’s going on but it’s going on on a regular basis. Call it training, call it being prepared, call it being ready to address a disaster, and we do have very capable and competent people, not only with the City of Winnipeg but also with the Provincial Government working together for these potential emergencies.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you. As a City Councillor concerned with crime in our city, and in particular violence against women, every year thousands of women are abused by their partners. We have women’s shelters filled with such women. Can the Mayor tell us, does he support an entertainer coming to our city who has been charged and convicted against…with such serious crimes against women and if he does support this, despite the Mayor of Halifax stating on the record that he does not support it, how can he explain that to our youth and tell our youth that that is an appropriate role model in a city where crime is at its highest in Canada.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p45 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I think the Councillor is already aware of that. I was actually asked that question yesterday on my radio show and I made it very obvious that from my point of view, I don’t think anybody on this floor of Council would support something like that. By the same token, I would like to think that the Councillor would take a broader approach to that. Let’s talk about professional athletes. Let’s talk about everybody Mr. Speaker. Let’s not just talk about a performer. This unfortunately, is not the first time this has happened Mr. Speaker, okay. And unfortunately, it will probably happen again, but the realities are the public has the right to make that decision and from my point of view, I would do it with my feet and my pocket book by not buying a ticket. I certainly hope the Councillor would do the exact same Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p82 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Of course you can be guaranteed I won’t be supporting such an event. Last month at our Council meeting I asked a question about the golf EOI process and my specific…I had two questions and one unfortunately has not been answered yet. My first question was whether the Mayor in fact knew whether the Golf North proposal was received before the closing of the EOI, and in correspondence back and forth with Golf Services, I understand that it in fact was received after the closing time of the EOI and I also have, in an email from that department, that there were more submissions and that this is common practice, and I would like to know…my question is, whether the Mayor feels that this is responsible tendering processes when a deadline means nothing and another proponent can come along and put a bid in long after, months after, not even a matter of minutes. Is this, and what would the point of a deadline be on such a proposal?</P>
<P class="p67 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I believe it was just last week where we had actually a Council seminar on the ASD of Golf Services. I know you were there. There were a total, I believe, of five Councillors there plus me. That’s number one just put that on the record. Number two Mr. Speaker, the Administration has a process they go through when putting out EOIs, RFPs, whatever the case may be. I would assume that if a deadline was extended, they had a valid reason. It’s obvious to me that the Councillor has spoken to the department so hopefully she would know the answer to that question. I have not spoken to them on that issue, but the realities are, they went through a very open process. We all saw what the process was. They made a decision and in the end this Council made a decision, and the realities are Mr. Speaker, if someone had attended, that they would know we’re still facing a financial scenario which we have to deal with in the very near future, and sooner or later this Council is going to have to make a decision and it’s going to cost taxpayers money.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. The Transportation Master Plan that Council approved in 2011 called for the City to, in the short term, and I quote, “develop a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> pedestrian strategy and develop a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> cycling strategy that provides integrating guidance for the City’s efforts to support cycling activity and connectivity.” Many people were shocked to learn last week that the pedestrian and cycling strategy had been cancelled. It is well known that a consultant had been hired to do the work and that work has now stopped. I would think many of you recall the challenges of implementing <NOBR>one-off</NOBR> projects that were faced in 2010 when we did a list of active transportation projects without adequate time or capacity for proper planning and public consultation. It seems to me that memories are a little short here and that there’s been a big oversight. A quick scan of major cities in Canada show that most, if not all of them, have extensive cycling and pedestrian strategies that obviously took human and financial resources to put in place and I don’t think Winnipeg is particularly different than all those other cities and that we too need to plan our transportation infrastructure projects. I’m allowed a <NOBR>pre-amble</NOBR> and I’m going to get to the question, but I want a brief <NOBR>pre-amble</NOBR> here. Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure is part of the transportation system, and I hope that this Council understands that. And I’d also just like people to know that I only found out that the pedestrian and cycling strategy had been cancelled by accident when I asked Public Works for an update, and they told me in an email, “due to the current and foreseen short to medium term human resource pressures within the Public Works Department, we are suspending the pedestrian and cycling strategy until further notice.” That’s a pretty scary statement that speaks to the impact of previous and current budget decisions, and I’m also aware that members of EPC have been upstairs recently with their scissors working through the 2014 budget process, and that the directive to stop the study came during this time, so I would suggest that this is a very <NOBR>short-sighted</NOBR> approach and my question to the Mayor is, are you open to <NOBR>re-considering</NOBR> this decision to cancel the pedestrian and cycling strategy?</P>
<P class="p36 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, through you to Councillor Gerbasi, she is absolutely correct. There are many people here who seem to have a short memory, so I’ll remind her.</P>

<P class="p18 ft1">July 17, 2013</P>
<P class="p45 ft4">There was no Active Transportation Strategy or policy or anything until I became Mayor. We had no active transportation. We had a few cycling routes through parks etc., we had nothing Mr. Speaker. We were so far behind the rest of the country it was an embarrassment, and it was a result of yours truly listening to delegations, getting the support of Council that we have come so far in such a short period of time Mr. Speaker. We have invested $80 million in six years Mr. Speaker. We have gone from approximately 150 kilometres of trails to almost 400. We’re almost triple where we were. So you know what? I think we’ve done a pretty good job and I think we have a good grasp of what’s going on. That’s number one Mr. Speaker. Number two, the realities are that the situation was quite simple at that point in time, and I know there was quotes from the Chair of Public Works as well, and I can tell you that I have had conversations with some of the people who are a part of that Committee as far as looking at options to get a study done. There were concerns about the dollar amount Mr. Speaker. As you know, on a regular basis, we get criticized for consultant fees. Just open up the paper anytime when there’s discussions on consultant fees and the key thing was to make sure that we were trying to get value for the dollar. It does not mean that projects are not being done as we speak, and Councillor Gerbasi knows that. She was at an announcement with me three weeks ago on Pembina Highway okay. You can see right now on Disraeli Bridge, we’re building an active transportation path. This work will continue to be done Mr. Speaker, and I think all we’re doing is trying to make sure that taxpayers’ dollars are spent wisely Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p40 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>And I do acknowledge the amount of work we’ve done in the past, and I’ve done that very publicly and I do support that. I just wanted to…my second question, I’ve looked over some of the consulting contracts, because that seems to be what this is about as well, awarded for other infrastructure projects in the city and just to give you a couple of examples of how much we spend on planning, design and public consultation which is what this is. Plessis underpass we’re spending $750,000 on planning, designing and public consultation for that project. Pembina Highway underpass we’ve already spent 800,000. So these are just single projects so obviously significant infrastructure projects like that require significant investment in design, planning and proper consultation. My question to the Mayor is this. Are you saying that by cancelling the Active Transportation Study that was doing all of that, that you do not consider city- wide cycling and pedestrian infrastructure to be as an important part of our transportation network, aspects of our infrastructure that are also deserving of proper planning, designing and public input, not just being built <NOBR>“willy-nilly”.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p23 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, one can choose to talk the talk or one can walk the walk. I think yours truly and Council has walked the walk and we have shown what we can do, that’s number one. I’ll just leave it at that.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question?</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Mayor. In response to the cancellation of this strategy coming to the public’s attention, the Mayor and others have said that the money from the cancelled project will be spent on specific active transportation projects rather than planning and I would like some clarification on that. According to the 2013 adopted budget, in 2014 there was supposed to be $1.25 million identified for walking and cycling projects. Is the Mayor saying that that number will be increased by the amount remaining in the contract which is at least over $300,000 to my understanding, and that that will come out when the 2014 budget comes up that we’re spending that amount of money more than was projected in the past?</P>
<P class="p24 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, what I think the answer to the question is quite simple as that one, the idea is to spend the money on capital projects. Number two, as I already answered but obviously the Councillor wasn’t listening, I have been having dialogue with some of the people who were part of that proposal to find alternative ways to see if that could still be accomplished, so the dialogue will continue and I’ll remind the Councillor of how a lot of these things got started. It was something called the Marconi Line. You may or may not recall Mr. Speaker, alright, it’s now the North East Pioneer Trail. That was a project the City of Winnipeg worked on for years to acquire that line from the railway and we made all sorts of offers Mr. Speaker and we got nowhere until we worked with the private sector who ended up saving us about a million and a half dollars on the acquisition, and then made a six figure donation towards that line and I will tell you and any Councillor here who has that pass through their ward will tell you, it’s one of the most used and most active of active transportations that exists in the City of Winnipeg. So for anybody on this floor to say that we are not moving forward with projects, totally false Mr. Speaker, and we will continue to do that.</P>

<P class="p56 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Winnipeggers watched recently as Calgarians and Torontonians suffered from major rain events and major flooding in their cities. Would the Mayor be prepared to offer our Council a Council seminar on some of the preparations that are being done? How our Emergency Operations Centre can gear up as well as updates from Water and Waste. What is the capacity of our sewer system, our land drainage sewer system, to respond to these types of events? Winnipeggers are feeling very confident, we have a lot of experience in dealing with floods coming from the south and floods from the Red River thanks to the one in seven hundred year protection provided by the Winnipeg Floodway, but what about massive rain events? Not too long ago, Northeast Winnipeg, Transcona, North Kildonan, had a major rain event where a lot of basements and areas were flooded, and again we saw it on a small scale recently but there’s a fair bit of an incident in South Winnipeg out in the vicinity of the Ikea site with a flash rain event recently. What if a big event happens throughout the city?</P>
<P class="p57 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker this hits close to home. Three weeks ago tomorrow there was a torrential downpour in River Heights, Tuxedo, Charleswood. I was flooded. My entire basement was flooded, so from my point of view, I think this would probably be a fairly realistic approach to make sure that…I’d be happy to call a Council seminar, keeping in mind you’re going to hear certain scenarios over and over again. Certain things are not built for one in seven hundred years or one in five hundred years or one in three hundred years. They’re built for the norm and unfortunately we can see throughout the country these things are happening, but I would be more than happy as per the request of Councillor Browaty to call a Council seminar and have our departments bring us up to date. It would be my pleasure.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>This is just a quick <NOBR>follow-up.</NOBR> As part of that briefing, could they also explain what the backup plan is for the Emergency Operations Centre? As we know, it’s in the <NOBR>sub-basement</NOBR> of this building. In a flood situation, far from ideal.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>There’s no reason that can’t be part of the picture. Absolutely Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thank you. Through you Mr. Chair to the Mayor, first of all I want to thank you for supporting my office through your office regarding the <NOBR>trans-loading</NOBR> station that was…I’m saying “was” is the news…was planned for the corner of Lindsay and Grant Avenue. Would have been incredibly, incredibly destructive. The City, unfortunately, doesn’t have control of those lands. That’s under the Federal Transportation Act, which is part of the problem that we mentioned before. There’s three levels of government involved here, however when most people ask me Mr. Mayor to stop doing this, don’t bother trying to take on a rail line, is it going to happen, put your head down and accept it. Well people in my neighbourhood and myself, we refused to admit to go with that, and with your support we were able to stop it. So again thank you very much for that. So my question to you though is, I believe we need to keep working on the issue and I hope you will. I think we need to be working on the issues with the Federal Government and all stakeholders to remove rail lines if we can from residential neighbourhoods. If we can. Look at the options. There’s no “one shoe that fits all” option. Looking at stopping just the industrialization of these rail lines, especially within residential neighbourhoods. Can we look at some model like that? Can we even look at something as wild as having rail lines share a rail line for dangerous goods outside the city? This is something the City needs to be a part of, if not leading, and so I look forward to working with your office and continue on that, and would you be willing to look at something, a task force or something to look forward to trying to move this issue along.</P>
<P class="p67 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p80 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker I thank the Councillor for that question. When I was first made aware of what was potentially taking place, I truly could not believe that anybody was actually thinking about it and Councillor Orlikow and I looked at each other and said, well this is crazy and you know, we both lobbied the Federal Government and Members of Parliament, and I would say in this instance, I think we got lucky. You can’t count on that all the time, and to be very frank with you, I think the suggestion is a good one. There have been other scenarios that have happened before. I just think we have to be very realistic that anytime you actually talk about moving rail lines, it becomes a very costly scenario and everybody has to come up to the table and as you know, any politician throws that out about moving this or moving that. It’s great fodder for the media and they love to talk about it and ask questions, but the bottom line is, where are the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars going to come from, but to be very frank with you, I also think we at City Hall and all of our departments, have to make sure that we do our due diligence and sometimes don’t give them the opportunity to do things that we weren’t actually sure that they could do and it turns out later on it’s beyond our control and I think that was the instance here Mr. Speaker, so I think that we should all be doing our due diligence. I think it’s</P>

We all have issues in terms of trying to deal with having enough housing somewhere and getting it placed and actually then having people being able to afford to purchase and live in those areas and I just wanted to note that I appreciate this effort and I wanted to say that maybe someday we could look at a similar kind of effort down Selkirk Avenue or around in our areas where the developers want a little more something to inspire them to build more housing. So I mean, real great support, CentreVenture, and the Downtown Committee. It's a good job, it's innovative. I think it's great and let's try to apply these concepts where we have other housing problems. Downtown is a jewel but we have to also worry about what’s called the centre of the city. Thanks.</P>

Number one, just so everybody understands that this is a joint initiative between the City and the Province. In this situation, when you increase, you go from 10 to 15 years and that extra money comes in from the TIFF point of view, is that the City will be investing in one area and the Province will be investing in the other area.

I’m sure Councillor Gerbasi will remember those comments on many occasions and here is the situation where we can try and do something very positive and get more and more people living and we all know, more people living in a good environment, in a safe environment, great lighting, having the amenities is not only good for our downtown. Our downtown is the heart of the city. It's good for the entire city of Winnipeg and I certainly would encourage Councillor Eadie and I would be happy to bring it up as well. See if the Province is interested in something of this ilk in other parts of the city. That might be a…you know, progressive move. So I just want to say that and also to commend that the chair for moving what wasn't an easy project, forward. So I do commend for that as well.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p55 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Sorry, I had my hand up. Well, I guess my problem with the proposal is that this is almost what I feel is the second kick at the can. And we had the same concern when we had CentreVenture getting a big loan to do a hotel. I mentioned the same concerns about allowing the market to do what the market has to do. So what we are doing here as we’ve done in the past with the Downtown Development, whatever it was called, allowed developers to come in with certain rates and certain I guess funding, to develop all these units. So one argument we are hearing in the report is that there’s…we need to have more money given to somebody. It ends up in the developer's pocket. I don’t think we have to…instead of lowering the price, they don’t…they have this extra money here and I could be wrong. That’s what I’ll be asking in a second, but the first phase obviously didn't work which I’m being told. We built it, they didn't come. That's what happened. That's what I’m hearing happened, however, when I read the real estate, the realtors guide, the real estate…the realtors mag, they’re very buoyant on it. They’re saying this is looking great. We have…and just last year. We have tons of new people coming in and look at SKY, SKY’s development. We only have unit left, then I look at yes, there’s some view about street side or having some problems, but again they are priced really high, I’m not sure maybe they blew the market, missed the market on that one. But I’m not seeing that in the real estate board or other people saying that we're not…we're not…we’re having this problem. Again, if we are that’s…that is a problem because we do want to have density downtown but now we're going to…we’re saying we’re going to give 10,000 per person who’s going to pay for this building that we already subsidized once already and now we’re going to do it again because first time it didn’t work so instead of allowing the market to have these unit condos go down in price, i. e., there’s a risk and reward ratio in private enterprise. The risk is here’s some funding for you. You guys develop your condos, your apartments as you see fit and then you will be on the hook to sell them. That's called risk. And now we're mitigating that risk for the developer again by offering instead of developer, we're offering the resident, the purchaser $10,000. Well, maybe the developer can lower the price. These aren't cheap, that we go up to anywhere and they try to massage it, but really if you can find a $200,000 condo there, I’d be amazed, besides the saucership one, but generally the prices are around $300 to $400, $500,000. They’re very expensive, well done condominiums, they’re beautiful. I've looked at them myself. Issues about parking, perceived safety, grocery stores, those are other issues too which maybe I think the City should be focusing more on that energy rather than the subsidy idea. So I guess my first question is for the chair is please explain to me why there’s lack of demand. Show, give me some numbers that say these condos aren't being bought up and we have to do this because again I am a free marketer. I do believe that the market will take care of itself. We can help it a little bit, but this seems that we’re helping it twice over. So I believe why, and maybe you can answer this question. Why don't we just allow the developers to do what they need to do and lower their entry point prices. Maybe they'll even have to take a loss and that's called risk and reward. Maybe they won't. I don't know but again, the market will determine that. So I’m concerned that we’re jumping into this and becoming involved in market speculation and development and we’re getting into areas where I don't believe that city councillors really should be involved in. This is the market. Let the…we can help it out, this seems to me, we're helping quite a bit, twice over. So I’d be more than happy to hear from the chair or anybody else where I erred if I have, but at this point I won't be supporting it.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p55 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thanks, Mr. Speaker and I do appreciate the Mayor's comments about downtown first. And I think if we have…we have a unique situation in downtown. We have a large downtown and there’s unique problems that we have to come up with innovative solutions to address and that was the intent of this program. And I wanted to comment on a couple of points about it. You know, we helped the developers in that area when we built Waterfront Drive, when the former Mayor and Council had the vision to put a road through there because we spent public money building that road to make that area livable for people. This is not just handing out money from some other taking it from recreation or some other service that we have in Winnipeg. This is tax increment financing. So if this development doesn't happen, no money will be given out and I think that's a key thing the public needs to be reassured about that. We aren't taking</P>

<P class="p87 ft4">money from other sources that we would have. This is money we won't have unless this thing works and it's the same with the downtown. The downtown subsidy program and other areas of downtown worked fine and those areas are developing and being sold. In this area, there’s problems and that the…there’s a lot of empty projects that aren't even proceeding because they aren't getting the sales. So it is a real issue that CentreVenture has outlined in detail that it’s just...we aren't going to get those tax revenues at all and so those tax revenues are going to be used for a direct subsidy to the people purchasing and l already received an <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> today, I’m going to lose Fort Rouge residents because some of them are going to move downtown. I’ve had one today who said, “I’m sorry I’m leaving because this is the type of thing we need and it's not just…it’s a $10,000 sort of incentive for the people to move there plus they’re making a commitment to stay downtown for five years. They’re not flipping the apartment, they’re not …to an apartment. So they’re making a commitment to move into a unchartered, almost area that doesn't have services, you know, so there’s a number of reasons why this is a very unique situation. Another reason that it didn't work as predicted like originally the first program, people thought that would work. One of the problems is that the parkade that was supposed to be built hasn't happened yet and I don't know a lot of details about that, but it's a complex negotiation with the Province and the City. It hasn't happened. So when they originally said they were going to build some of these units, they thought they could offer at least one parking stall to people. Well, if they don't have any parking stalls, you know, it's challenge and that’s one of the other issues. That’s going to take a few more years. So there’s reasons why it went into difficulty, that's one of the reasons, that’s going to be a few years away till that parkade that we were trying to get done is going to happen. And so I just want to make it clear, it's…some of the new tax revenue from all of these buildings is going to go for that. Subsidy is one small portion of it, it’s going to go into other things to make the area livable and attract downtown residents and I think as the Mayor alluded to earlier, we all understand that we need people living there to have a viable downtown and I think everyone agrees with that. We’re not taking revenue away from other city, important programs or from people, we're creating new revenue and taking a portion…that wouldn't happen without this and taking a portion of that and investing it into the downtown to make it livable and then we’re taking the rest of the money and we're going to have some more money to do the other things we need to do in the city. So I hope that clarifies some of Councillor Orlikow’s questions and you know, it is a bit tough to get your mind around and it’s complex and I can understand if some members of the public, they think we're giving away money, we're not giving away money, we're only taking money if these things develop and spending it to make sure it's successful in the area successful, and then we'll still have some new tax revenue for the City. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p88 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I just…maybe Councillor Pagtakhan can give some clarity here. As I understand it now, we currently have a Downtown Residential Grant Program in place that provides up to $40,000 per door to the developers for the creation of the unit. The last time I saw the numbers, those units were averaging about $27,000 that they were getting on the doors, I don't know what the numbers are today. If we’re still running that program and I assume we are because we’re not going to have the product unless we run that, then we're going to fund this out of the remaining 5 years, the years 10 to 15 is where this is going to come from. I’m not seeing the 10,000. You know, if we're only getting 13,000 or 27,000 in the first 10 years when your net present value back what you might achieve in the last five years, it's not going to get to $10,000 a door so I need some clarity there. Because you’ve got to carry the cost of that out the whole 15 years to get to years 5 and 10, so you’re not going to realize the $10,000, I don’t think. I’m just doing this math quick as I’m sitting here, so somebody has to pay some attention to that. I’m going to support this because I think the concept is good, we need to move forward, this is incentive, it does cost money. Tax increment financing on residential is costing us money. You might want to represent that it doesn't, but the reality is it does. We're taking, we’re moving people from somewhere else, we’re bringing into these redevelopment zones but these zones are places that we should be making investments. This is how you change a city. This is how you redevelop a city. This is money wisely spent. We also have a downtown housing strategy that sets some targets that I didn't see in this report unless I missed it. There’s…we were supposed to have annual reports, we had…I think it was a five year plan. We should have those numbers here with us showing what have we got now with this? How many units do we have under development right now? What is the rate of absorption of the units? Are we on track with what we set out as our downtown housing strategy? We should have those numbers here when we’re making this decision. So, I see there might be some problems with this in laying it out. The principle I think is good and I think getting rolling and finding the answers to those questions as we roll is appropriate but I caution everybody that we want to make sure that we're doing correct math here and that we're actually getting what we set out to get. So hopefully the good Councillor can provide some perspective when he responds and I’ll have a little more comfort when I vote in support. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further comments? To close, Councillor Pagtakhan.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate all the dialogue and debate on the issue here. The fact as the matter is there hasn't been a lot of development happening within that east Exchange and this is what it's all about, it’s about creating development in part our downtown within the Exchange and Waterfront Drive area. This whole program Mr. Speaker, has been vetted through CentreVenture Board, through the Province of Manitoba and</P>

<P class="p56 ft4">through some of our staff here, through Property and Development here at the City of Winnipeg. I am committed, I think this program should move forward and what I can do, Mr. Speaker, for the rest of our committee and if any other Councillors are interested, I am willing to ask CentreVenture to come forward to provide information moving down the line on the numbers for downtown housing as well as more of a financial picture relative to the tax incremental financing piece. So, I just want to say that you know this is a…there’s a whole menu of options here. We’ve got the purchaser incentive program which is one component of this. We also have the initiative to attract retail in the area, Mr. Speaker, as well as improve the images in the area. CentreVenture recently did the Market Avenue redevelopment in our cultural district and as well as that this program also includes parking initiatives and strategies for a car share <NOBR>co-op</NOBR> program as well as Mr. Speaker, for some initiatives to create the more safe and well lit districts. So there’s a whole myriad of options as part of this comprehensive program, and I hope that we can get the support of Council moving forward. I want to thank my committee members, Councillors Browaty, Fielding and Gerbasi for unanimously supporting this initiative; thank the Mayor and EPC for pushing this through, and like I said, I’m committed to getting the information going forth at my next committee on the numbers for housing downtown as well as to answer questions on the financial pieces as well as the tax incremental financing piece.</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. I wasn’t going to ask the Chair any questions today, but I realized that he still hasn’t answered some of my questions from our May 29<SPAN class="ft15">th </SPAN>meeting. Specifically I asked him for an update on the effectiveness of the new permits process and any improvements in response times, and his response to me was, “I will ask the Director of the Department to have something either for the Committee meeting or for the next Council meeting.” I have to say that I don’t recall seeing any efforts or any information on that, and I’d like to ask when the Chair will get some answers about the permit process and what is he doing to improve response times?</P>

Scheduled appointments for residential inspections are averaging less than a week down from about two weeks a year prior. Service for commercial inspections remains strong, usually same day inspections and consistently less than 72 hours. While residential plan examinations and permit issuance times are still about a week, longer than what the City is targeting, (inaudible) 50 percent reduction in residential new housing permit issuance times compared to a year ago. Five year residential permit programs are consistently averaging less than five days. Commercial permit issuance times have been improved. Thirty percent or more reduction in permit issuance times for interior alterations and new commercial permits compared to the previous year, however, despite the improvements they are not yet where they need to be on those types of commercial inspections…permit issuances…sorry.

<P class="p25 ft4">program is operational. To date, over 25 projects involving new commercial buildings have elected to participate in that fast track program. In terms of increasing capacity, the division has been successful in recruiting for some long standing staff vacancies. They are optimist that as individuals in these new and other temporary positions are trained and become increasingly efficient, that turnaround times will continue to drop. In terms of application quality, there’s been issues in the past of what’s been submitted. The division has implemented more rigorous permit application screening process, particularly for commercial interior alteration permit applications. The result is improved completeness and quality of the permit application submissions which improves efficiency of plan reviews. Again not a lot of this…less of the back and forth where somebody submits something and a week later realizes that there’s some very glaring errors and omissions on what’s being submitted. So in summary, there’s an improvement to the work that is going on. Significant progress has been made. Commercial permits turnaround times remain a key area of focus for further improvement and the department is optimistic that efforts will continue to move us in the right direction.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you for that very thorough answer Mr. Chairman. I’m impressed and I was just wondering as a <NOBR>follow-up</NOBR> to that, has the Chair consulted with the building community, and what is their level of satisfaction with the turnaround times now?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p30 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>There’s no shortage of times where I hear from the community where people are not getting the information submitted in an expedient fashion. From time to time, I actually do go and further investigate the circumstances. I’d say it’s pretty much 50/50 where it appears that there have been efficiencies in the way the department has handled the issue and probably the other half of the time, there are a lot of instances where what’s been submitted was not up to anywhere close to what should be submitted. In a lot of cases, professionals, whether it’s engineers, architects, plumbers, etc., are submitting plans that are nowhere close to accurate just because they’re busy and they want to blame the City for holding onto information that’s not complete and they can say it’s not me. It’s the City when in fact what they submitted was not anywhere complete or sufficient.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p95 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you. Also at our May 29<SPAN class="ft15">th </SPAN>meeting, I asked the Chair about the purchase by the City of the land where the fire station on Taylor was built. Can the Chair provide us some update on that purchase?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you. As you are aware, the fire hall audit report is overdue. We are expecting that information. The Standing Policy Committee did ask back in November for a process to start on having both sides do appraisals. I’m not optimistic that that’s going to resolve the issue, so we definitely do need to look in the very near term as to what our options are in terms of the property.</P>
<P class="p82 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions for Property and Development? Seeing none and we’re three minutes to twelve. We’ll adjourn to 1:30 and come back for Protection and Community Services, Infrastructure Renewal and Finance. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p100 ft1">STANDING POLICY COMMITTEE ON PROTECTION AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</P>
<P class="p60 ft1">DATED JULY 4, 2013</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to move Items 1 and 2. I’m assuming that there will be some debate on the cat or rather the responsible pet owners. And item no. 4 as well, so 1, 2 and 4.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Do you want to stand down 1?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I want to speak to the item.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>I would like to stand down No. 4 as well.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>So we’re just talking about 2 and 4 right now. All right, so we’re just voting on No. 2. All those in favour? Opposed? Carried.</P>
<P class="p101 ft1">Item 1 - Agreement to Establish the Winnipeg Police Service School Resource Officer Program in the St. James - Assiniboia School Division</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I just want to introduce this, I will have some comments on Councillor Havixbeck’s making some comments as well. This agreement, school resource program, first of all, it’s been a very successful program. <NOBR>Three-way</NOBR> funding normally. What happens is the Province gives <NOBR>one-third</NOBR> funding to the School Division of their choice, decides to kick in <NOBR>one-third</NOBR> funding and the City through the Winnipeg Police through in- kind services kicks one third funding to make this program happen. We know that there’s a number of these resource officers that are out there. They’ve been very successful I think in the community. The concern with this one is for the St. James one, you know, putting officers there. The funding model that we used in the past isn't there where the school divisions actually had to pick up <NOBR>two-thirds</NOBR> of the funding and that the City picks up the rest through <NOBR>in-kind</NOBR> donations. The big concern and tried to be raising this before, is that the Province's signal to us that 2014, they want to review the program. So I’m not sure if they in technical government terms that that means you know it's signed, sealed and delivered to kill their funding for this program or not, but there’s some major concerns of going forward in terms of the school resource officer. So as we always do in St. James and I know you concur with this, we…when we need to step up to the plate, we do. The school division has put…kicked in <NOBR>two-thirds</NOBR> funding because it’s the right thing to do and that’s what we do in St. James of course. So it's a fantastic program that's there and it’s a good funding model that's there but there’s a large amount of concern in 2014 if the program, if the provincial funding is there. I’ve got…I just got a review here from the Safer Community’s fighting crime; it’s the Premier's campaign promises in election campaign and under the Safe Communities fighting crime, how we'll do this, there’s a commitment to expand the successful police in schools program, assuming that's what they’re talking about, so clearly, they promised to expand it or at least have it in there. In fact, their words to expand it, yet what we're hearing now from the Province is that they’re not willing to enter into a funding agreement for this one particular project. In fact, they’re reviewing the whole project. So my concern is whether a funding cut to gut this program is signed, sealed, delivered already. So that’s the concern we have. I’ll stand down and hear other speakers.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck. Yes, sir, sorry.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Would you allow Councillor Steen to take off his jacket and wave Council protocol? It’s a motion. It is a motion.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Do I have a seconder? All those in favour?</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Nay, no just kidding.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Show us the guns, Thomas, no. That’s right. Anybody who wishes to take off their jacket certainly has the Speaker's permission. At this point, Councillor Havixbeck you were about to make a presentation.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I was going to speak to this item. I have been an advocate of the SRO Program for our city for some time now and I’m pleased to see these two additional resources for our city. And I think it's incredibly important that this be viewed as a proactive step in crime prevention for our city and yet another opportunity for our Winnipeg Police Service to work closely and build relationships with the young people in our city. As many know, SROs address</P>

<P class="p25 ft4">issues around bullying, cyber bullying, potential fights after school, drug, gang activity and that's a city wide problem. The only contact for some kids that they have with Police is when they come to their homes to maybe address issues of domestic violence or other kinds of crimes and the statistics from the Winnipeg School Division show that SROs have a contributing hand in helping kids stay in school longer and some people even go on to a career in policing such as cadets or police officers. And this is incredibly important because as many of us around the table are parents. We send our kids off to school, and as a single mother of two boys, I can appreciate the importance of school safety to our kids and for teachers. As some of you may recall, on the day of the Newtown Connecticut tragedies, I was in Calgary at the police headquarters actually learning more about their program, which is in both their private and their public school system and is city wide and we as a Council, I believe, must be proactive and be leaders in this. How many people know the true magnitude of the gangs in our city? We all probably don't really know that. Our Police Services people do know that. And the number of lock downs that’s occurring, real lock downs, it’s not just the practice ones. They’re increasing. I am particularly pleased that the chair has changed his view on this and that I’m assuming EPC members are supportive. As some may recall during the budget deliberations, I brought forward motions to this effect which were turned down and I brought a motion forward to have four new SROs in our city so that every school division could have them and at that time, the Chair of Protection and Community Service sent this into a fire storm of activity to the administration for a report and I have yet to see the report and that was January. I’m pleased to see that the chair, with new information, has changed his mind and will support this and he will see the benefits directly in his ward, since these SROs will be assigned there. These are new SROs for our city and I’m profoundly touched by the school division support, the St. James Assiniboia School Trustees contacted me about this, contacted me about the motion I raised for this, and they have worked hard to find the <NOBR>two-thirds</NOBR> of the funding. That is incredibly significant. As the chair said this is usually a tripartite agreement between the City, the Province and the School Division. And the Province’s share is not at the table but the School Division has stepped up and I believe that that's a true leadership position. Today, we need to continue to make this a permanent initiative. It should no longer be a pilot project It is still named a pilot project in the school division’s eyes and the Province’s eyes. This is a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> initiative that saves our kids from crime and gangs and makes the safer city for everyone and we need to stop the notion that it is a pilot project and make it permanent. And I hope that this will gain unanimous support around the table. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p82 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I was there for this announcement with members of the WPS with members of the school division and I think every man, woman and child believe very much in this program as, I think, all members of Council always have which is why we've always supported the idea of when the school division came forward, we were there with our resources. But unfortunately, some of the comments I just heard were anything but accurate, Mr. Speaker. For someone to imply that the chair has changed their mind. The chair has always been supportive and just for the record, Mr. Speaker, it was the WPS, the Winnipeg Police Service, who was basically against the idea that Councillor Havixbeck came forward with, because we have a plan in place. It works very simple. You have three parties, it's initiated by the school division and then the Province and the City come to the table. It's happened that way every single time except for this one. And in this instance for whatever the reason may be, I’m going to give the Province the benefit of the doubt, they are doing a review and hopefully they'll finish it and they’ll realize this is a good program. How they haven't come to that conclusion as yet, I’m not sure but everybody should give him the benefit of the doubt; we could move forward on this, but we should continue to do it the exact way we've always done. The School Boards like it, we like it, the Province liked it, there’s no reason for all of a sudden to just say do this <NOBR>willy-nilly.</NOBR> We have a process in place. Why would we possibly not follow it? And that's exactly what we are doing here and in this case, it was so important that the School Division decided if the Province wants to do a review and they’re not putting up the money for right now, we'll put up the money, but the City of Winnipeg through the WPS has always been there and if anybody doubts what I’m saying right now, please speak to Deputy Chief Art Stannard. He was the one who was critical of the suggestion, not the chair. I will be supporting this motion.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p34 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yes, Mr. Speaker. I'll be supporting this. As a former teacher, I realize the value of having the police officers at the school. They interact with the kids and they get information from the kids. Now, I understand that St. James has more crime now than it has in its former years and so I think it's very vital to have this pass to aid those schools. And I think what the Mayor said is right. There is no point in pushing something to other areas of the city if the school boards there have not requested it. So…but this is a good example of something that we can do. It’s useful and it’s been proven in Calgary and it’s been proven already in Winnipeg where the schools have had it so I’m fully supportive of this measure.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Speaker Nordman. I rise, I am in support of this particular decision here because the school division, the St. James School Division made a decision that they wanted to try this program for their schools and I applaud them for it. But, it is and I will…I’ll say again, it's up to the school division if they want to utilize whatever</P>

<P class="p28 ft10">resources they have, to decide to move ahead with a program like this because basically it is the School Board, the school division’s domain to make the decisions in this regard. We as the City Council, we wouldn't appreciate it if the school divisions started to decide what we were supposed to do with your our civic resources although some might mention what we should do but the point being though, is that I think that the school divisions can assess whether or not they need these programs. I know that other school divisions that don't have this program also have other programs that they run to try to do…to help out when it comes to crime prevention. So there’s many ways you can do it and what really needs to be noted here, Councillor Havixbeck did mention what this is, is this is more related to crime prevention. The kind of incidents that happen on occasion that are so awful, so horrific, this program is not going to be able to stop that. What the program is is prevention. It is…it gets to trying to keep kids out of gangs, trying to find out, they’re getting some information about what's going on with kids and that's progress and I just want to put on the record as well, when the motions put forth by Councillor Havixbeck at our Protection and Community Services, I spoke to this very same issue in the same way I just spoke now, and I moved…I moved the motion to really do nothing with it because there were no school divisions at that point coming ahead and saying that they wanted to do it, so that's for the record. Let's be clear about that, it wasn't the chairperson who was for or against. The motion was there and there was a vote and that's how it happened. But we all believe in the program, so thank you Speaker Nordman for giving me some time to speak on it.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Steen.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I was at that Protection and Community, too and I asked the Winnipeg Police and they said that any school division that asked for it, never been denied. And that's why we left it alone for the ones who didn't want it, we didn't want to force it on them so but maybe we should, I don't know. But at the time that's what happened, it was not the chair, that's for sure. Thanks.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further comments? Seeing none, Councillor Fielding to close.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Good, thank you, Mr. Speaker, and to address my good friend, Councillor Smith, I’m on crime stat here right now and of course when you accept the faults, you accept the positive, too. So in terms of St. James that for homicides, it's gone down by 20 percent over the last year, sexual assaults are gone down by 17 percent. Shootings have…shootings have actually gone up 28 percent. Minus 25 percent drop in commercial crimes, I’m going to spare you all the details here but essentially there’s been a 20 percent drop in crime in the St. James area just so you know, just to inform you of that. You know, quick comment, I think this is going to have unanimous support. I identified what my concerns are going forward with this. I think we all agree that’s a good program. Councillor Havixbeck, I know you…I think I was pretty clear during my comments and I’ll check Hansard, but I’ve been very supportive of the program overall. I just think as mentioned, the funding model’s pretty effective that works there, it’s <NOBR>one-third,</NOBR> <NOBR>one-third,</NOBR> <NOBR>one-third.</NOBR> You got the school divisions that are there. They’re supportive of it, you need their approval obviously to get into the school division so I wouldn't suggest we change the program in and itself. I believe that motion that you have brought forward has gone so it's something that the Police Board can review. We're obviously just in the infancy stage of getting it up and running but it is something that we can definitely review and you know as we go forward, we'll have some discussions. I will be setting up a meeting with myself and the Chief and to Minister Swan just to verify a couple of the agreements. There’s obviously the helicopter agreements coming up at the year end, too, so we want to make sure that the funding levels are continued on for that as well as the school resource program because I think it is very effective. So with that I will stand down and I guess we'll call the question.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>That concludes the comments on Item 1. All those in favour? Opposed? Motion carries. We're going to jump over no. 3 for now and let's go to no. 4. So Councillor Swandel, you stood down no. 4, we’re going to go to 4.</P>
<P class="p102 ft1">Item 4 - Agreements with WRHA for Provision of Emergency Medical Response Services, <NOBR>Inter-Facility</NOBR> Transport and Community Paramedicine</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding, if you’d just like to open on 4.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Yes, Mr. Speaker. I’m…you know, I’d like to hear Councillor Swandel's comments on this. It's a pretty straightforward. I’ve got some information that’s incorporated in the report but feel free to ask your question and hopefully I can get it addressed.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p40 ft18"><SPAN class="ft17">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>This is something that Councillor Fielding knows that...it's something that I usually, when we sat on the budget committee together, I’ve always brought this up every year because it seems to me that the citizens of the City of Winnipeg pay far more for ambulance service than anywhere else. We actually subsidize what’s paid for of any</P>

<P class="p103 ft10">cases by the Regional Health Authorities throughout the rest of the province with other revenues from the city. So, I guess if it’s not in this…at least in the package that I have, I’ve got a summary of the…of the agreement but no specifics. The agreement did not come in the report and so perhaps in closing, the chair can talk to us about how much city revenue is subsidizing the ambulance service, how does that compare to other health authority jurisdictions? And I’d also like to know on…in Schedule A, I believe it is, in the summary and some of the comments, it talks about the wait times for ambulances to off load at hospitals. It talks about bringing them down to 60 minutes which I believe is we already have but we were driving towards a 30 minute time which is what we had originally agreed to in the old contract if I remember correctly, with the Regional Health Authority but this seems to be pretty weak language in here that we are at…that we’re pushing towards 60 minutes before billing occurs but then it doesn't say anything about meeting a target of 30 minutes or what penalties would be in place for that. I’d also like a better understanding of, in the financial impact statement page on page six of the report. It would appear that even though there’s an increase in direct costs, there is a decrease in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority share of those costs. But without having the actual agreement here, it's difficult to understand how that happens. Maybe there’s something else being made up some other place but it seems to me that if we're going up by a couple of million dollars in cost, that the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority piece should also climb: their portion of that cost. So, perhaps we can get some answers to that today, if not today, maybe we can stand this down and get those back before proceeding. I don't know that if this is time sensitive or not but it seems to me when we’re talking about millions of dollars, that are potentially at risk out there in these agreements that maybe a little time for a little more due diligence might not be a bad thing.</P>
<P class="p104 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p55 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I’ll be brief. But I do recall a couple of the things that Councillor Swandel mentioned and specifically regards to the 30 minute reduction, I don't see that in here as well. I do recall also there was some issue around collectability of some of it and there was some year of the ambulance wait times for offloading patients at the hospital of back items that the WRHA hadn't paid or hadn't acknowledged. So I think that it would be appreciated if the chair could clarify some of that perhaps in an addendum. And I just like to reinforce that that piece of this…I know from having gone through the budgeting process three times it seems to be coming a revenue stream, those fees. Eventually, the goal is for all of us to get the wait times down to a satisfactory level that people feel paramedics aren't tied up at hospitals. So it's not a sustainable revenue stream as I see it and I don't think that we should undergo any more agreements in future with that as a premise. I think that that's incredibly important so that’s all I want to say on that.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Seeing no others. Councillor Fielding to close.</P>
<P class="p55 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Sure. Well, I’ve got some comments on this. I mean, I don't know if this is time sensitive of, I don't think it is. I’ll try to clarify some things but if people want it laid over, I don’t necessarily have a problem, but it’s fairly standard going forward. The agreement does cover emergency medical services, <NOBR>inter-facility</NOBR> transfers, hospital to hospital transfers and community…this is the community paramedics. Emergency responses are cost shared 50 percent by the user of the service, 25 percent by the WRHA and 25 percent by the city. The off load delays, penalties and fees and processes are obviously included. <NOBR>Inter-facility</NOBR> and community paramedics are 100 percent funded through the WRHA. That’s the ethic, what they call them. Those are the ones that the community officers that are there. New language in process has been developed for cost recovery for first nations transportation. The agreement defiance the primary service areas and a minimum business required for long term planning and system reports. Clearly outline the WRHA responsibilities and the Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Service’s responsibilities. The agreement outlines the responsibilities of the joint operations committee and the Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Services as well as the WRHA reps. So they’ve got a group that meets together. The group meets monthly and oversees things. They talk about policies and procedures; other items such as operational performance and benchmarking; defining scope of emergency response, <NOBR>inter-facility</NOBR> and community paramedics. They talk about disaster planning which has been a topic obviously we talked about today. We talked about review of patient care issues and concerns and improvement in public education, 911 dispatch, the parties are also committed to assisting the Province of Manitoba in working towards implementing 54 recommendations. There was a big report that the Department of Health through the Minister, has recommended 54 recommendations for EMS review in an effort to improve EMS services in rural Manitoba. At the present time, seven rural paramedics are enrolled in the Fire Paramedics Advanced Ambulance Care Program and the ….in the city have a long history of working together on this issue. The part of the recommendation that’s going forward, there’s a number of recommendations that have been brought forward. Any implementation of that would, would have to come back through here with different implementations for the Council. So I’m not sure if I answered all your questions, but that's the premise of the program. We obviously are working down to the …and it's taken a very long time, too long in my opinion. It is still hovering around the 60 minute wait time and there’s a reimbursement in terms of that, but can we do better? Yes, we need to do better with it, but this outlines kind of the agreements going forward with it in terms of compensation through the WRHA and the paramedic service in terms of how we're going to cover this off. There is some wins I think with <NOBR>inter-facility</NOBR> transfer as well as the ethic service that's a part of it. So I hope that answers most of your</P>

And I will be speaking to the whole clause and I know there’s a few motions before us, I guess we've got the opportunity to speak but most of my comments here I think. First of all, I think that there is many positive aspects to the Responsible Pet Owners <NOBR>By-Law</NOBR> before us. We know obviously that there’s been a few changes since it came to us last in February that were part of it. We know that it's a merging of two different <NOBR>by-laws</NOBR> that the Pound <NOBR>By-law</NOBR> and the Exotic Animals <NOBR>By-law</NOBR> and I want to really thank</P>

<P class="p110 ft10">our staff, who worked hard on it, Leland Gordon, I think he’s in the audience right here, who worked very hard and Clive Wightman in your department for all the work that you have worked. There is some important changes that I think can really make a difference here, part of this <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> going forward, and so I do want to deal with a number of the issues that have been brought up today. The first item we’ll talk about, well I’d like to talk about is in terms of urban chickens. That’s something I know there is motion here that’s before us in terms of the layover portion of it. You know, the report talks about keeping the status quo and I very much support that. I think that there’s been a number of stakeholder agencies and organizations that have been consulted with this, the Humane Society that’s here, we understand what their opinion is on the subject and very articulate in terms of what their concerns may or may not be in terms of changing what the status quo is right now. There’s been consultation with people like the Manitoba Agricultural et cetera on the potential, the impact of the availability of you know what happens in terms of the neighbours whether it be for smells, whether it be through things like mice, flies, rats, you name it, that's a part of it. And there’s also a part of the B.C., the B.C. society for the prevention of cruelty’s also made a comment in terms of that, in terms of the status that’s there. So I think the process is flexible enough where you can still have this. It just needs to be in an agricultural area. My concern is the livability portion. If you broaden it extensively, so very happy with that portion staying the same, the next piece that we talked about is excess animal piece and there is a small number of changes from the original document brought forward. First, there’s going to be the banned list or rather the legalized list versus the banned list that's there. We know that there’s a consensus on this, but I can tell you that we've done a number of things. We essentially cookie cuttered, took a cookie cutter approach to what Ottawa’s doing. So it’s not something we're reinventing the world here. What we’re doing is another jurisdiction that’s had some great experiences as part of it. Yes, it’s something that we’re following forward with it. Another bit part of this is in terms of anyone that’s had, has a reptile or any animal that's on the banned list will have them for their life. It’s grandfathered in so there’s no impact in terms of people that have those … We're not saying take your reptile or whatever it is and leave the City of Winnipeg. It's grandfathered in. Another important part of it is in terms of the special permit, special permit that’s part of it allows people to apply, that’s if there’s a some sort of reptile, it’s not on the list, the CEO of the Animal Services can make the judgment on it. If they don't like this idea, what they can do is they can appeal this, it’s appealable to the standing committee that's there so I think it makes a lot of sense. You look at organizations like Pet Traders and Petland is also very supportive in terms of the changes that we've made in terms of the area. In terms of pit bull bans: Pit bull bans we’ve obviously maintain the status quo in terms of that. I don't think that there’s need to go into it right now so. Overall, there’s a lot of positive developments about this <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> I think it's been a long time coming, I think there have been some good stakeholder relations and development from it. There is parts, I’m not going to surprise you much but I’m not supportive of the cat licensing piece. My personal opinion is that it is a tax grab. I’m not supportive of that. I think it establishes a new bureaucracy, 167,000 cat bureaucracy that’s out there, and I don't see the correlation between what's there in terms of getting a licence, versus the issues in terms of spay and neutering. I think that’s a major issue for the City of Winnipeg. There’s been some organizations that have come up and propose some things, which I think makes some sense. And I think at the end of the day, who actually, the people that are actually going to be using these licences and we've talked about other jurisdictions in terms of the amount of people that are doing it, there’s people like myself, the responsible pet owners, the people that are you know responsible that maybe had their cats spayed and neutered that’ll be there, they’re the ones that are going to be doing this licensing piece. So I don't see a correlation between this. I think that there’s some opportunities to do the spay and neutering, the questions always will, would you support taxpayer funding going to this as opposed to this, isn’t it? And the answer is quite simply yes. I think it's a major issue here in the city of Winnipeg and to support some sort of you know approach where you’re able to address the spay and neutering pieces, I think makes a lot of sense. So, with that I think that I won't be supportive of it and there is also some questions that people have raised in terms of the differences. So you know, how come a dog, how come you require a dog to have a licence and you don’t have to a cat to have a licence? And quite simply, there’s a number of, there’s a number of differences if you look in terms what the difference is. We know with dog licence they get a free ride home. You know that we invest taxpayer dollars in things like dog parks that are there, you have adoption, you have foster types of programs that are affiliated with the dog licensing, but you don't have the cat licensing so my concern is, is there a <NOBR>two-tiered</NOBR> system in terms of cat licensing versus dog licensing that’s there. We also have some experiences and I’ll quote some of them in terms of some of the areas of other jurisdictions that have tried this. Of the 15 major cities in Canada, only 54 percent have mandatory cat licensing. Larger city in Canada, Toronto has found that their cat licensing process is cost prohibitive. Since 2011, they started debate on how to dismantle it. We know that only 5 of the 15 cities actually publish intake numbers and only two of the five have cat licensing <NOBR>by-laws.</NOBR> So there’s a number of concerns generally that I have with it. I think if there’s a way we can help in terms of the spay and neutering piece with the proposal that’s coming forward, that makes sense, but I think the cat licensing piece is just something that's, in my opinion, isn't needed. You’ve got examples all over government, this isn’t necessarily about cat licensing in itself but governments are sticking their hands in everyone's pocket whether it be PST, whether it be all these fees and charges and quite honestly, I think people have had enough. They had enough with this and I just think that this is something that's a tax grab. I don't see how it’s going to benefit owners. I just don't see it. I think if you want to invest money in spay and neutering, that's a better approach. So with that Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude. I think that I will be supporting the whole <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> going forward. I definitely will not be supporting the cat piece, but I think in terms of the other aspects, there’s a dramatic step forward. I do also want to address some of the circus, the fellow that came in today and talked about some of the circus aspects for it. I am interested in what he had</P>

<P class="p107 ft4">said, in terms of some of the special permitting. I know we made that criteria, one in terms of the excess animal or not the excess animal but the exotic animal piece where if you want to…you want to apply, you’ll be able to get some special permit through the COO. I think that's something, in new information come forward that other cities are doing this. It’s something that maybe we can look at another time. I’d like to keep the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that we are going before us whole and then we can take a look at that at another time so it is an issue that I want to look at to see how other jurisdictions are doing it. With that I will be supporting the <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> but I will be pulling out the Section 2 that deals with the cat licensing, I’m not supportive of it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p43 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>We have a <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> by or motion by Councillor Pagtakhan that I think we should discuss. So you’ll have three minutes and Councillor Fielding will have three minutes to rebut and then we'll have a vote.</P>
<P class="p51 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Basically, the reason why I have put this motion forward, Mr. Speaker is just to provide the advocates for Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association with an opportunity, Mr. Speaker to make their case. And basically that's the basic premise. At the whole premise of this is about pet ownership and the whole <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> speaks to responsible pet ownership and that’s really the core and essence of this whole thing and including, I think Mr. Speaker, a responsible pet ownership piece for the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association and for those folks in our city, there’s a handful of them that do have chickens and they’re currently…they’re not allowed to do that but they’re trying to fight for their cause and Mr. Speaker, I know there’s issues with respect to health and chicken welfare and all those other things but I think that the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association has done a great deal of homework. They’ve actually had an opportunity. They came to the Executive Policy Committee and one of the delegates was actually said she spoke with the Provincial Veterinarian’s Office, Mr. Glen Duizer, and so I made a call to the office and spoke with one of the other veterinarians over there, pretty high ranking, and he basically said, “You know what, the City can do whatever it wants. We will work with the association, the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Keeping Association to manage this thing if that's the case”. So all I’m saying is give these folks an opportunity throughout the summer to prove the case and perhaps for Executive Policy Committee to hear it again and if there is any merit to doing it then let's move forward. Basically, I think there’s some merit, Mr. Speaker where folks…I was on their web site and they actually talk about how to design a coop and animal welfare and <NOBR>bio-security</NOBR> and proper food handling, all that kind of stuff and they also talk about…but I think there is some merit in having a course and the Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association can actually administer the course and people who are interested in keeping chickens Mr. Speaker, must pay for that. So let, put the onus on the people who really want it and at the same time we’re creating a sense of a solid policy and criteria for allowing urban chicken keeping in the city. I don't think honestly Mr. Speaker, that there’s going to be a huge take up. There is probably a handful now and if this hypothetically were to be approved in the future. I think there will only be a few handfuls in the future. I mean at the end of the day, let’s give these folks a chance and perhaps I don't think that Winnipeg Urban Chicken Association and their members are verse to having a licence on the chickens as well. So at the end of the day Mr. Speaker, if we can allow these folks, we are the city of opportunity, I think. If we can allow them to have an opportunity to keep these chickens and to love their hens and everything else, then so be it. So that’s really where I’m coming from on this, give them a chance and I’m asking Council to lay the matter over at least to give them an opportunity to make their case and let’s hear it in September.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Councillor Fielding, three minutes.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>I don't need three minutes. You know, I think all the information is there before us. I think a lot of the experts have spoken on it. You heard from the Humane Society, you heard from Animal Services, you heard from some of these other organizations that are opposed to it. We’re not disbanding it all. It's obviously allowed in agricultural areas, I don't see any reasons why we change suit at this point. Councillor Havixbeck had mentioned again I know there’s a lot of these lands in Charleswood I think that people probably rent out some of these lands if people do want to raise and do what they want to do in these areas, but I don't see any reason, I don’t really see what…and I respect the motion coming forward but I just don't see what another month is going to do because we’ve got all the experts, we’ve got, our experts in our department, we’ve heard in terms of some of the issues that are associated with administering it you know in a whole bunch of ways and I think quite frankly some concerns from residents. You know, I don't think that…it might be important to some people but all to the neighbours, you understand it's laid out in the report in terms of the reasons why it could be harmful to other people, harmful in a livability type of way I’d say, Mr. Speaker. So I will not be supporting the motion going forward.</P>
<P class="p21 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>All right, that concludes the discussion on laying over Recommendation no. 8 in the report. So I'll ask for a recorded vote. I’ve heard that over here. So all those in support of laying this over as it states in Motion 8, please rise.</P>

<P class="p33 ft13">WHEREAS the Draft Responsible Pet Ownership <NOBR>By-law</NOBR> attached as Appendix A to Item 3 of the Report of the Standing Policy Committee on Protection and Community Services dated July 4, 2013, defines “school” to mean a public school or a private school, as those terms are defined in The Education Administration Act;</P>
<P class="p30 ft13">AND WHEREAS The Education Administration Act defines “private school” to mean any school, other than a public school, which provides a curriculum and a standard of education equivalent to that provided by public school, but does not include any home or place to which 262(b) of The Public School Act applies;</P>
<P class="p30 ft13">AND WHEREAS clause 262(b) of The Public Schools Act applies to home schools and other schools where the parent or guardian is expected to provide a standard of education at home or elsewhere equivalent to that provided in a public school;</P>
<P class="p30 ft13">AND WHEREAS public and private schools can use commercial animals to provide a standard of education as described in The Public Schools Act;</P>
<P class="p27 ft13">AND WHEREAS raising chickens provides educational experiences and practical applications in a multitude of school subjects;</P>
<P class="p34 ft13">AND WHEREAS the Draft <NOBR>By-law</NOBR> currently exempts public schools and private schools in section 29(3), but does not exempt home and other schools;</P>
<P class="p34 ft13">THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the definition of “school” under Definitions and interpretation, section 2(1) in the proposed Responsible Pet Ownership Draft <NOBR>By-law</NOBR> in Appendix A be changed to read:</P>
<P class="p27 ft13">“school” means a public school or a private school, as those terms are defined in The Education Administration Act, and including any home or place to which clause 262(b) of the Public Schools Act applies.</P>
<P class="p103 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes. Thank you. Three minutes to present? This is a…again it's kind of related to chickens but in the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that is about to be passed what has happened is, it used to just read the public schools could have commercial animals, the definition of school being just a public school and in amending this Act, we've added private schools and there’s one other type of schooling that does happen in this province and it's called <NOBR>home-schooling.</NOBR> And I…there’s a lot of value in the ability to utilize commercial animals in the learning process for students. And I don't know why we would prevent <NOBR>home-schoolers.</NOBR> There is an issue and I’ve heard people talk about well if they want to teach them about animals and it's multifaceted. You learn mathematics, you learn about social aspects, you learn about many different aspects of education with this and <NOBR>home-schoolers</NOBR> do have to meet a standard of education as the level of the public or private schools. So in order to establish an ability to do that, it's pointed out that well, you could take your home schooled student out to a farm and they could learn that way but I would point out that you could do that with public and private schools as well. Why are we giving the public and private schools the ability to do this on their property and when</P>

<P class="p28 ft10">they could actually do the same thing. They could just send their students out to farms and they could learn that. So why not provide, what I’m saying here is why not provide the <NOBR>home-schooler</NOBR> with the same advantage of having their home- schooler student being there to learn for example about chickens. It was mentioned today at question period. It was a very good presentation made about what a student has learned about dealing with chickens and actually once the home schooling is over, technically they are then illegal. So what a student will have to learn is how do we, in our agricultural ways, how do we deal with, dealing with, if you’re trying to get out of the business of chickens? So there’s also another learning experience that could happen there. I would point that out, so this amending motion just changed the definition of school to add <NOBR>home-school</NOBR> places to allow it and eventually those students will grow up and they’ll get…they’ll pass their curriculum and I would also point out as well, that if the learning from growing chickens is important, the field officers as they call them in the Public Schools Act, they will be making sure that there is a curriculum value in that, in that it is making an educational standard. So I think this is just a simple amendment and I hope that everybody agrees with me and we just change the definition of school in the proposed new <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that's coming down.</P>

<P class="p53 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Okay. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be fairly brief. I just wanted to make a couple of comments on this issue, it’s an issue that's been around as long as I’ve been on Council which is a long time now, and in fact, I used to chair Protection and Community Services many years ago and way back then we were trying to get a lot of these things done at least some of us were and it's nice to see a lot of these things getting done now. One in particular that I’m very pleased to see is the ban on circus animals, exotic animals and circuses. Harvey will remember back in 2001, we tried to get that done when way back then and we didn’t have the support at that time and I’m really pleased that I’m hoping we will have that support today. To me, it's just simply an issue of right and wrong and how we should be treating animals. Exotic animals should not be performing in circuses. There’s no way travelling around eight, ten months of the year, we’ve heard it from the Humane Society, it's just simply something that isn’t right and it isn’t necessary. We have Cirque du Soleil, we have all sorts of other ways that circuses can operate. And so I think it's a modern, appropriate decision that I’m very, very pleased about. On the issue of licensing cats, again, according to Leland, we've licensed dogs for a hundred years, maybe we should’ve licensed them both at the same time and we wouldn’t be having all this debates for years and years about it because basically you have animals; you pay a small licence fee and that goes towards the cost that the City has to deal with animals. In this case with dogs, a hundred percent of the revenue goes back to the Animal Services to pay for our costs in managing people. Dogs, responsible or not responsible, we have services for dogs if they’re needed and many people who have dogs never need to talk to Animal Services the entire time of their dog's life but they still pay a licence fee and nobody is complaining about that. With cats, you know, it’s…the difference is instead of a hundred percent of the revenue going back to pay the City's cost for those of us who are calling it a tax grab or whatever, the 50 percent of it is going out to help deal with the real problem we have which is not enough spaying and neutering programming. And some can argue and I agree it’s not going to solve all our problems with feral cats and spaying and neutering, it’s not going to address…it’s not going to create that stand alone clinic that we’d all like to see. It’s not going to address every problem to do with animals but why would we say no to taking a step in the right direction towards that? There’s a couple real benefits, first more spaying and neutering resources for the agencies that do that and plus the licences, I don't understand the logic that it won't return more cats to their owners. The Animal Services is very clear that it will because they’ll have a tag. If they…not every cat, many cats do not have the chip so whatever, so they will have these tags and they will get returned to their owners and that's a positive thing, it takes the heat off the Humane Society and it gives the cats a home. So, I don't see a huge pot of money you know, materializing from some other source and if we already, if we were to just not have a revenue stream like this created like we have for dogs and for the services they need, you know are we going to put that in the budget and have all this money go to cats? Like I don't see that being supported by Councillor Fielding and others who are very concerned about raising general property taxes because that's where it would have to come from. And I think this is…yeah, we could do more and perhaps we should be doing more but this is doing something significantly more than we are doing now so that's my main point I wanted to make there and with that I’ll be definitely supporting this. It's been way too long to get to this point and I think it's a very appropriate approach and a very similar to what other cities are doing. Thank you.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p103 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yes, Mr. Speaker. Initially, I was supporting wholeheartedly this <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> But you know, when it was originally before our committee, the Humane Society was against it. Now, Animal Services is suggesting they get half the licence fee and they switched their position. You know, I’m not in favour of any organization getting funds from the City of Winnipeg that kills 2500 cats in a year. I mean they killed 2500 cats. The obvious answer is that we need a spay and neuter clinic, where anyone can bring their cat and have it done at a low cost. I’d rather have all that money go to something like that, than giving it to an organization that's killing cats every week, 2500, 2500 cats they kill! You know, now there are a number of organizations in North America that have a <NOBR>no-kill</NOBR> policy and there if you have a no <NOBR>kill-policy</NOBR> it puts the emphasis on them to find the adoptions, find ways of doing it and they succeeded. We could do the same in Winnipeg. We don't have to kill 2500 cats and for that reason, I’m not very supportive. But let me tell you this. There are some good things about the <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> proposed <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> The circus thing as Jenny Gerbasi has mentioned, I have fought for that for years and it seems to me reasonable, about time that Winnipeg went along with this. I mean, you know, wild animals…transporting them from city to city in cages, to me, it's not reasonable. It's torture. You know, so I’m supportive and I was supportive in the past and I’ll be supportive now to go ahead and change that policy. And let us ban exotic animals in the circuses. You know, just put yourself in the shoes of people going to the circus. There are many circuses that don't have exotic animals and they are successful in North America. So there’s no reason why we should not all be supportive of this section of the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> Let me tell you this, I looked at my <NOBR>e-mails,</NOBR> I got an <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> from someone from California telling us that we should, in effect, allow circus animals. I mean, the people of Winnipeg I’m sure as a whole do not support the idea of allowing exotic animals like lions and so forth, wild animals being trained to be in circuses. It's not natural and we should all be supportive of that section of the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> Otherwise, as I say, the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> is basically good in many areas and I originally was a supporter of licensing of cats but you know when I hear 2500 cats killed in 2012, it doesn't make me very warm to the idea of giving money to the Humane Society, an agency that does that. They could establish that agency as a <NOBR>no-kill</NOBR> agency as many other places in North America have done and are successful. You know, the pressure is on them to have programs to get the cats adopted. You know this way there’s no pressure on them. They’re happy to get the funds and feral cats are a real problem in the city of Winnipeg and we have to address it. We can't leave it year after year. The cats are increasing. I was at the community…EPC and I told them, I left my door open and I had a cat come into my house. You know, like there are so many cats running around the streets. Now I don't know if there’s a hundred thousand but there’s certainly a lot of cats. In fact, Councillor Swandel, I’m sure will have something to say about this as always. But let's face it. Licensing of cats will give these to agency monies and it takes the pressure off them to go ahead and get them adopted. If they have a no kill policy, I’d be very much in favour. It puts a pressure on them then to go ahead and have programs for encouraging adoption and that's what we need so that's why I reversed myself and Leland, I think you can understand that.</P>
<P class="p113 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you. I can't imagine what would motivate a cat to go into Councillor Smith's humble abode. Sorry, I couldn't resist.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Oh, come on, go on.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Listen, I just wanted to make a couple of points here. I think it's unfair when the good Councillor had the opportunity to ask the question of Mr. McDonald when he was here to start characterizing the Winnipeg Humane Society as a place that wants to go about killing cats. You’re going to have some more cats on your door step right away. I think this is important to realize. I think the Humane Society all through this process has made it very clear, they do not want to be killing cats. And they see this as the opportunity to start moving in the direction of becoming a <NOBR>no-kill</NOBR> facility. I don't want to leave what Councillor Smith just said and did floating in the air here. You know this is some cat murdering facility and they take great joy and pleasure out of doing this. I think we all agree they do not this is a responsible <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> The Winnipeg Humane Society is a responsible organization. Our head, our Chief Operating Officer of Animal Services and the entire staff of Animal Services are responsible individuals. We do not want to see any animals harmed in the City of Winnipeg and I just want that clear on the record, and I hope I have the unanimous support in the characterization of the Winnipeg Humane Society as a good organization in the city of Winnipeg and not to be characterized the way they just were.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p40 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Okay. So first of all, I do want to commend the City for many of the aspects of this responsible pet ownership <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that make a lot of sense. So again there’s a whole big piece of it that I’ll be supporting wholeheartedly. and even the idea of licensing cats which is the one I’m still having some problems with. The idea had some merit, however, I believe what they want to do with the funds is generally what I call bad tax policy. When you charge, in my opinion, how I look at it is you charge a user fee for services that those people that directly receive or not receive if they don't need them; so licensing cats, you know, we talked about nine percent return maybe getting up to 20 percent, maybe. That's a service those individuals who pay that licensing fee receive. That I can…that makes some sense and</P>

<P class="p28 ft10">some other services that are in there as well. These all make some sense but when we take responsible pet owners and making them responsible to pay for really a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> issue that isn't specifically their issue because sure they love cats, but does that mean they have to pay for everything for cats? No. What it does mean that's a city issue. Feral cats to me is a really big city issue and that…why I say it's a bad tax policy is that money should not be raised by a second party who just likes cats and has to get a licence. So licensing cats maybe makes sense on one part but to use those funds for pretty well spay and neutering feral cats that they don't own, that I’m still having a really big problem with. I also have a big problem with the way that the $50 fee... I think having a $50 fee annually is an incredible amount of work for internally and administratively. Every year, we’re going to have people <NOBR>re-register</NOBR> these cats for $15? To me, that's…to me, very cumbersome, very over bureaucratic and if their point is as we look through the motions that the other cities have done, they’ve actually dealt with some of the serious issues though, seniors, kittens. They’ve given kittens under six months don't need a licence. They’ve done some things that modify. People on assistance that can’t afford the $15. Now, what will happen with those people? Are they just going to chuck all the cats out to the street? Of course, we know people love their cats and they’re going to have a really, really hard time doing that. Some people, maybe not love them so much but they’ve got some. So again, I have a choice of either getting some milk today or pay for licensing for my cat. Well, I can guarantee you the choice that every one of us will make is the milk. So again, there’s nothing in this by- law that helps people out that this will be issue for them. So again, other cities, Calgary, Toronto, other cities have done this who have done cat licensing. We are silent on that as well. So therefore, I believe it is a bad tax policy by the spay and neutering part. I mean the licensing has some merit and we should try it, but again not if half that revenue was going over to which really is a general city issue. I also think it should’ve been much more flexible in addressing some of the barriers that individuals have who have to pay this and I thoroughly I believe it's especially, very over bureaucratic by having year after year so while I don't want to see this feral cat population explode, is this the best model that we can do to address this? I’m really leaning towards no. I think an independent spay and neuter clinic partially funded through the University of Manitoba, whatever model would be much more in line out of a <NOBR>no-kill</NOBR> shelter when everyone, I don’t care, but having responsible pet owners pay for a city issue, that one I’m still having some real major problems with.</P>

<P class="p55 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m…will be voting in favour of the <NOBR>by-law.</NOBR> Had some issues about bees but I think we'll have to address that at some other time, I think everybody probably has some little part of this they’re not delighted with, but the package I think is good. I wasn't going to speak today but I have to speak in the wake of some of the comments that have been made at EPC and here in pertaining to the ban on exotic animals and circuses, so I find myself cast in this unlikely role of commenting on the ban of circus animals and I really take issue with the presentation that says, well, those who have spoken in favour of the ban, the word ‘lies’ was used, lies or liars and they’re using selective information and what you, Winnipeg City Council should care about is in Windsor, in Newmarket and Toronto, there were legal cases and Councils there got lost on the ban (inaudible). We were told this paid hundreds of thousands dollars in legal fees. Well, if you’re going to accuse out people using selective information, you can go to the internet and look. I’ve been looking right at the Windsor decision. I looked at the Newmarket decision earlier. The other thing we heard how was the judge …we…the circus folks didn’t even bring up the Charter argument. It was the judge who came in with that, and it was so obvious that you know we didn’t even have to raise it, the judge came in. If you look at the Windsor decision, the applicants who are the circus folks raised at enormous length many, many paragraphs of the Charter argument, so that’s some selective use of information. And number two, the Newmarket decision, the result was split. The City had some success, the circus folks had some success, so the City had to pay $14,000, true, the City did have to pay, not hundreds of thousands of dollars so if you’re going to say other people are using selective information and arguing against your position you better give us the full facts, and we didn't get that. What we got was a kind of odd presentation and we got…I was sitting there last night wondering why I was getting <NOBR>e-mails</NOBR> from Connecticut, Colorado and Texas and it occurs to me, I don't know if this is deliberate or not but it appears to me there was an attempt made to give us a mass of information to have before us so that the applicants in the court case in Manitoba could say they had all this information, all this data and they chose to ignore it. We aren't ignoring it. We’ve got it…we’ve considered it, what we also had was expert opinions from people like Mr. McDonald from the Humane Society, we had Appendix K right here in front of us saying these are what other Canadian jurisdictions do, banning exotic animals. The idea that Windsor tried it, Newmarket tried it got shot down and everyone else left the playing field, completely, factually inaccurate. Jurisdictions in various different provinces do this…still on the books, places like Vancouver so this isn't small towns as we heard from some folks. So we’ve got this great wealth of information put before us. My view is, I think we've been given satisfactory information by our staff, by the experts we have, by the people who made deputations at EPC talking about the treatment of animals. This is not, in my view analogous to the Windsor situation. If you look at the Windsor decision, the courts stress reading the transcript of the debate, so I’m going to go on for a little bit here and give my take on this. I think different Councillors will have different reasons for voting for the ban, but the Windsor decision was found to be in bad faith because the circus folks didn’t get a hearing. We had public deputations at EPC, we’ve had it here, we have paper galore, we have <NOBR>e-mails</NOBR> from the people who are opposed to the ban. So they’ve had a hearing, there was allegations in Windsor that the…somehow, that the Council had a legal opinion before it saying they couldn't do a ban based on the issue of animal welfare, so they tried to climb this from the public safety and I think that's why you’re</P>

<P class="p56 ft4">hearing presenters say, “Well, it's no more dangerous to go to the circus than it is to football or baseball or basketball or hockey.” No one’s raised that here, Mr. Speaker. None of our materials have raised that argument. It's been countered by other people, I would suggest quite possibly, for a subsequent court case. This isn't the argument our staff have given us. It isn't about protecting the spectator at the circus. This is about animal, about what I believe to be a power completely, an action within our powers to regulate how these animals are treated. There’s a whole separate argument about this may be a federal power if it encroaches on the criminal code provisions against cruelty to animals. Nothing in our material saying we’re regulating cruelty. This isn't that we're banning some animals, not others. This isn't that we are creating some sort of procedure that if we, the City perceived there’s mistreatment or cruelty, well, there go it fine, this is a blanket prohibition. You can still have a circus though. You can come in and have a circus. Those animals can still be housed in the city of Winnipeg in a zoo, so there’s not a complete ban on different types of animals. From my perspective, this is within our power as a city. We don't have any sort of legal opinion that we are ignoring here. Maybe they did in Windsor. We don't have that. I think we're acting in good faith, we’re not encroaching on federal criminal powers. We’re not, in my view, we’re taking actions that even if there’s some…the idea that there’s a Charter right to perform with exotic animals, and we also heard, they only do these things in the wild. I think anyone has ever seen circus acts with baboons riding bicycles, I have no memory of ever seeing that filmed in the wild speaking personally, but we have facts in front of us here, we have the opinion of our experts, people like Mr. McDonald, so I think if anyone ever, this ever does end up in the court and some Queen's Bench judge or justice is reading what we've had to say, people are voting for it for different reasons but as Councillor Gerbasi and Councillor Smith have said to their credit, they've been fighting for this ban for a long time. I think it's within our powers. I think it’s in keeping with modern urban centre. Vancouver does it. Various other jurisdictions do it. I don’t think there’s been no bad faith here by this Council. They’ve had ample opportunity to lobby to be heard, to present to us, so from my perspective, I’m voting for the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> and I do want to get on the record though, my view that we’re acting within our powers. We’re not acting to breach anyone's Charter rights here. It's a reasonable limitation on your freedom of expression that you’re not allowed to perform with exotic animals in a circus in the year 2013.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks, Councillor Mayes. Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, thank you, Speaker Nordman. I'll just start off with, you know, this is not a perfect <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> for everybody. I am in support and I’ll be supporting all of the motions, all of the…the whole report even though I do…I don't understand why we can't have chickens. I think some of the arguments about not, and let's make sure we get it clear. Chicken hens, not roosters, chicken hens, that's what we're talking about that the Urban Chicken people are interested in. But, and you know, there are a lot of people but who might want to have chickens but in the context of this whole large city, I don't see that we’re going to be overrun by chickens any time soon. I think that most people are too busy in their days and they’ll still go to the Hutterites to buy their eggs or wherever it is the source that they pick up their eggs. The…but you know and in terms of the whole discussion about what is really about food security and making sure that you know the food that you’re eating is safe and it’s fed properly, you know we've heard about how the treatment of animals that we eat can affect us in terms of the uses of steroids, uses of antibiotics and all that, but anyway, I don't want to go there, just to in order to, not get so detailed, the cat licensing, you know, I have to say and I said this at EPC and I’ll say it again, yes, we are killing cats, there’s no doubt about that. That's why we have a big problem in this city, but if we don't pass this <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> and we don’t pass licensing, the situation will be the same. It will not change. It will not change and there is a possibility and we are moving forward in terms of cat licensing. There are plans and I’m sure that the City will work with other people to solve the feral cat problem, which again cat licensing isn’t…is not really necessarily dealing with, although, I mean the opportunity to still, if the Humane Society is…and I have to wholeheartedly agree with Councillor Swandel when he speaks out on behalf of the WHS because they don't want to, but they’re…you know, the reality is with the cat licensing, 50 percent of the licensing will go to spaying and neutering programs. For now, the only facilities that look like that would be able to utilize it is the WHS and a couple of others, however I will point out that we heard a presentation from I believe it was the president or the person who heads up Craig Street Cats and she has said that there is a movement now, in the not for profit area, to establish a no kill, spay/neuter clinic in this city and under this <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> there was an amendment at Protection Community Services to ensure that if that condition does happen, it's within the COO’s discretion then to move the money that goes to the Humane Society and those two other organizations and move it in to a place that is going to help solve both feral cat problem and to ensure that people can afford to have their pet spayed and neutered because I think that goes to a lot of reasons why people don't spay and neuter their cats. It can be expensive and yes, that’s true but when you do take on the responsibility of having a pet, that's what this is about, the Responsible Pet Ownerships <NOBR>By-Law.</NOBR> And yes, in some ways, responsible people will be paying for some programs that they may not be the cause of, but the point is, is that there needs to be a revenue source as well associated. What we have here is a special operating agency that I just learned today does receive, I believe it's property tax supported money of approximately 900,000 that goes to it. Plus it raises money through other ways, through dog licensing and so on for different programs but I have to say and everybody around this table, we know it. We have huge budgetary issues to deal with and at this point we do have to raise taxes if we want to continue different programs but really this is a way and Councillor Fielding is right. This is anything that a government charges, I call it tax, so it is a tax, but it is one, in which there is expectations of some</P>

<P class="p45 ft4">service and I heard people arguing that somehow dog licensing is paying for dog parks. Well, dog licensing doesn't pay for dog parks. If we have them, the Parks Department is paying for those, it has nothing to do with dog licensing unless someone wants to correct me, but I don’t know that that’s there. I just…I think I really want to conclude with a couple of other things. There is this special permit and we heard from…a presentation from a falcon owner. I believe two falcon owners actually came and they’re fully licensed through the Province of Manitoba. Their whole facility in their homes is inspected. The way they transport them is inspected. These falcons are used for hunting. These people will be able to prove that they have a proper operation and I’m sure that the COO will see fit that they will get a special permit, but please note when we’re talking about chickens, if the Province is willing to go in and inspect and look and say, this is what you must have in place in order to have your chickens, have everything that actually Councillor Smith mentioned, if the Province is willing to do that and maybe there’s an option for a special permit for chickens as long as they meet the requirements or like pigeons in this city, it has to meet a whole chicken coop regulation and so on. Pigeons are under the zoning <NOBR>by-law,</NOBR> so while I don't agree that I did want to stall doing this thing with chickens, I really say that in the future, because chickens are not going away, it’s going to keep coming back and back and so are bees, we heard from Councillor Mayes about bees and I still don’t understand why we’re banning bees. Bees aren’t like…it's just…it’s unbelievable to me. So I think what we have to do as a Council and we’ll probably hear about it in the future, it isn’t going away that we have to look at it from more of conditional zoning and if the Province is going to do the inspections and carry out the things that are going to cost the City of Winnipeg money, which we’re not going to be able to find the money to do, then…</P>

<P class="p115 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further comments, questions? Councillor Fielding to close. Oh…did he…Councillor Eadie, do you want to close further on the other or you…</P>
<P class="p23 ft1">Councillor Eadie: <SPAN class="ft2">(Inaudible)</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>I thought you just did your close there. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p55 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m going to keep it fairly brief. I do want to make a few comments in terms of the. You know, I think specifically on some of the cat piece, back to the cat piece, of course. We all agree that spay and neutering is the big feature, and it just…it strikes me a little like we're using the cat licensing as a funding source almost, like a pyramid funding source to get to the spay and neutering when everyone agrees should happen and needs to happen, for it to happen whether you have groups that are opposed or disopposed. So you know, once again, I just don't think the cat licensing is something that is merited. If it's just a funding source to get the spaying and neutering, you know I think there’s some other ways we can take a look at that. I think that even if you look at the actual hard numbers that we’re talking about, the Humane Alliance brought forward their motion and I understand they might do something anyways with this, which is a good thing, but what they’re saying is that you…you’d be able to…they would be able to provide somewhere around 850 procedures on a yearly basis. The funding model that we have in place for the cat licensing will raise and I asked the Humane Society and other organizations, how much does it cost to actually do a procedure, spay and neutering procedure that’s there. And the ballpark was $40 so quick math tells you, you would be able to do possibly about 200, 200 more procedures with that funding model that’s in place but (inaudible) on the Humane Alliance, their proposal is coming forward, you’d have four times actual amount of procedures that would happen. So I just think that's a better process if it's a funding model, if it’s a kind of a Ponzi scheme, to fund the spay and neutering, you know, I guess everyone has to live with that but that’s just my concern with it. In terms of the spay and neutering, I think there’s also something, you’re laughing, done in terms of the facility if you want to provide a facility, there’s creative ways the City could get around this and help this process out without going to the spay and neutering that’s a part of it. I do appreciate some of the comments that have been had. Councillor Mayes, you know, I can tell you are a lawyer in terms of the way you’re reviewing this whole thing and I think that there is a lot of merit to what you said and you know there’s some talk obviously about the special permitting and once again this is maybe something we can take a look at, but overall, I think the proposal before us, it’s been a long process, it’s been a lot of engagement. You’re never going to get consensus for people whether it be the cat licensing piece; whether it be the exotic animals piece that’s there, whether it’s a yellow, red, pink, snake or not, but I think there’s a fair process going forward for that, I think that even with some of the additional animals you’re allowed with it, it makes some sense in terms of what we’re looking to do. The chicken piece, I’m sure we haven't you know heard the end of this but I think what's going forward, keeping with the status quo makes a lot of sense. So with that Mr. Speaker, I will call the question. I believe you’ve got to deal with the amendments first and then the clause in itself, and just out of a procedural basis, I want to make sure, what I would like to do is I’d like to vote, you know, some of the items, the cat portion, I definitely want to vote against. So I just want to make sure I can call the question on those items. Two votes? Okay, thank you.</P>

<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope…yes, I, we've asked for that report at our Infrastructure Committee on two occasions. I know the CEO is here to…the CAO, excuse me, is here. So I’m going to, through you, direct or ask the CEO to make sure that that report comes forward at our next meeting. I do hope that Councillor Smith is talking to our administration, our Director of Water and Waste or Director of Solid Waste to do the follow up to make sure that those bins get emptied because that is unacceptable, but I’ll make sure through the CAO that we get the report to our Infrastructure Committee in September.</P>
<P class="p78 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question, Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yes. Councillor Vandal, I understand Transit is having difficult recruiting bus drivers and I wonder why this is the case. The problem seems to be a vacancy due to the people quitting after a few years working for Transit. My question is how many individuals have left Transit in 2012, 2011, 2010 and in comparison with the year 2,000, 2001 and 2002? Anyways, I want to see why and you know I understand many of them are leaving the city for jobs, transit jobs in Calgary and Edmonton, et cetera. Can you please reply?</P>
<P class="p79 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I’ll take that question under advisement and I’ll get back to Councillor Smith with the answers although it seems to me that he probably or he has an interpretation of what he considers the answer to be but I will take that under advisement and get back to him.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, through you to Councillor Vandal. Regarding the cancellation of the contract on the active transportation, I’m wondering if you can tell us who the contractor was and…that was awarded the contract and how much money will…is remaining on the contract that was not spent.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>You actually…I don't know who the contractor was. I don't have that information. I could take it under advisement and get back to Councillor Gerbasi and as I have told Councillor Gerbasi last week, this is on our agenda for September at Infrastructure and we will have a discussion about the master plan. I don't think anybody was ever against the master plan but I think when you have a $400,000 consultant contract and you’re only spending 1.2 million every year which is not insignificant but it seemed to me that consulting contract was extravagant and nevertheless we will have a discussion on that issue.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Further…second question?</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Given that we spent $800,000 on other contracts for planning projects such as the Plessis Underpass, I guess it’s a bigger project but keep in mind, this isn't a one off, one project. This is a strategy for some cycling city, cycling and that walking strategies are 20 year strategies, so I hope you’ll keep that in mind and I guess my question is if you will, I appreciate you agreed to have it on the agenda, there’s a motion actually making it on the public agenda which was referred back. Are you prepared to reconsider this decision that was made behind closed doors without discussion with the full standing committee that’s supposed to be discussing these kind of policy changes.</P>
<P class="p78 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>I believe the Plessis, the Plessis Underpass contract is a $90 million project, 77, it’s going to end up, it’s a $77 million project. So I think that we need to have a discussion with the director at our next committee. I think…I don't think anybody is against having a AT master plan over the next ten years, but it's important to note we are spending 1.25 million this year, we spent somewhere…many millions over the next…over the past six years on AT projects. In fact, we’re spending $14 million on the separation of the Disraeli Bridge, which is largely for active transportation. So, we are committed to AT and we will have a discussion on this in September. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p78 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>One of the things that concerned me was in the response from the department was that they…the reason they gave for cancelling is that they don't have even the resources to support that a study happening. We have</P>

<P class="p137 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>That's the information we're going to bring forward in our discussion with the director in September, so we will have that chat in December and I think, bring it or make a decision at that point.</P>

<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal, $400,000 study, was this study written with a gold pen or how did it come over $400,000? Wouldn't that be money better spent on AT?</P>
<P class="p82 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>As you know, we are spending 1.2 million on AT this year. I think the decision was made to actually take that money and spend it on some real AT projects. I think we can probably do a master plan. I hope for less than $400,000 and spend more money on AT. We are spending 1.2 million. We spent 80 million in the last six years. We are committed to it, Mr. Speaker, but I think a $400,000 consulting contract is exorbitant. We can do a better job than that. We have transportation planners. We have a full time AT coordinator. We have the framework of a plan, Mr. Speaker. Our street grid system is not changing in any dramatic way in the next little while. The accesses and egresses at the downtown are not significantly changing. We have the framework of a plan and I think with some, with some tweaking, with some consultation, we will get there hopefully much less than 400,000.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question, Councillor Fielding, no? Councillor Browaty</P>
<P class="p40 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, through you to the chair. For the Winnipeg Blue Bombers pre- season football game, a plan was done between the Blue Bombers Football Club or the Winnipeg Football Club and the Blue Bombers and Transit to offer a blue and gold fan fare service that provided a pickup services throughout many communities. I’ve heard from residents in Island Lakes in fact, and as well as from East Kildonan, North Kildonan that the service’s been dropped for the first regular season game and apparently now dropped entirely is really a disincentive to use Winnipeg Transit Services to get to Bomber games more so even to get home because again it's easy enough to take a bus, you can figure out when the bus is coming to your neighbourhood, to pick up bus, to get downtown, frequent express service from downtown to the stadium, not the worst thing in the world. The problem is after the game. You can get a bus to downtown or to another connection point. Late evenings, buses don't come very often into the suburban areas of Winnipeg. I was wondering if through you to the Speaker, if the chairman was aware of this issue and he’s willing to look… ask Transit and Blue Bombers Football Club to look at other options to reinstate the service.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Absolutely, I’ll take that question under advisement. I will only say that the actual purchaser of services for the Winnipeg Blue Bomber Stadium are the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, so they will purchase what they think is appropriate to get fans to and from the stadium, but absolutely I will take that under advisement and get back to you</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty, second question.</P>
<P class="p40 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Again, I appreciate Councillor Vandal bringing that point up and again, it’s very clear, very important to make everyone fully aware that the service is fully cost neutral to Transit, is fully provided, paid for by the Winnipeg Football Club. Is he aware though that these decisions in terms of the scheduling and the routes and that are done as a joint piece between both Bombers Football Club and Winnipeg Transit.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>I am aware of that, but the actual entity that pays bills are the Bombers and so many of these decisions come down to dollars and I think we're all on the same page that we’ve got to provide the best possible service that we can.</P>
<P class="p29 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just to follow up on that question. I would very much appreciate…it's my understanding that that decision to not continue that programming was a decision made by the Winnipeg Football Club based on expenses. Would you be so kind as to verify and get back to us because that's what I was informed of and if it's different, I would very much like to know?</P>

<P class="p52 ft1">Councillor Vandal: <SPAN class="ft2">Absolutely.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Just a quick follow up to all of that. Are you aware that at the last football game, they achieved an over 30 percent modal split using Transit to get to the football game. A number that was basically unbelievable and everybody prior to it happening believed that it would never happen in this city and that was done because the right buses were used and the right type of service to get those people to and from the game. Over 150 buses are available after the game to start taking people off site. Were you aware of that?</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Actually, yes, I was and I think that’s something that bodes very well. I know many people took the new articulated bike lanes on Pembina Highway including Councillor Gerbasi to the opening game. So there were more people than ever taking alternative forms of transportation to go to the Bombers and that's incredibly positive.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Steen.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It took me 15 minutes. Thanks.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>I was not aware, but I’m wondering, did he take the bus or did he ride a bike?</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>All right, I think that concludes question period for Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works. We have one standing committee left, there’s no report for Finance, no motions, no <NOBR>by-laws,</NOBR> do we have question period for Finance Chair? Councillor Havixbeck for Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p138 ft1">STANDING POLICY COMMITTEE ON FINANCE</P>
<P class="p94 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to ask the Chair of Finance about the contract for the budget consultations. From what I can tell, the public process is still going on but when I went to the supplemental conditions of the tender process, page two of five has a little chart and it says that the conclusion of the public process would be done by June 28th and the completion of the final document by July 8. Now, I also note that the contract was awarded on May 23rd and in the document of the tender, it says it would’ve been awarded by May 1st. Is it true then that we are operating at about a three week behind period or can the chair comment on where the process is at?</P>
<P class="p78 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>As…thank you and I know that Councillor has been a strong supporter of the budget consultation process. So I thank her for her question as she is aware as well, the budget consultations, though it has to do with Finance, it’s actually funded by the Mayor's office and it's a function of the Mayor's Office and so I provide a supportive role, but it's going I think quite well and I just add some information, apparently 800 people, residents, filled out the online survey. There was more than a hundred that actually went through the effort of completing the mock City of Winnipeg budget online. It was a budget of course that had to be balanced when you filled it out online, which made it a challenge at times. There has been a telephone phone survey of some 600 residents in the city of Winnipeg, so it's a scientific survey and I’ve been told and there were six workshops I’ll say why, unfortunately they were not well attended but they were widely advertised and they were well attended. They were…but the, I think there’s obviously folks are taking the option with regards to the online participation seriously as well as many groups and organizations in the city were offered the opportunity to provide written submissions as well. So, and the good thing is actually the online survey, the budget simulator, written submissions are still open. People can still submit if you haven’t done this already and there’s going to be a report in the fall from what I understand coming forward. So I want to thank the Councillor for that and the report giving the feedback in terms of what we heard from the public so.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Follow up, second question.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes, thank you, and thank you for that important information. In my discussions with the consultant, I understand that they had made recommendations to significantly revamp the way our budgets are currently being prepared and I’m just wondering if the Chair can talk about why we haven't undertaken that route?</P>

<P class="p41 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Again, I haven't seen any report from the consultant on the consultations, obviously the Councillor is…she’s going on conversations, private conversations. She has information she could share, that would be great, but there will be a report in the fall and I look forward to seeing that.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Could the Chair give us a status update on the hiring of the EPC Secretariat <NOBR>re-creation.</NOBR> It's been about six months ago now that that money was approved in the budget and there was an expression that that was a significant needed, urgent…we’re now six months in, has…can the Chair give us some update, please</P>
<P class="p139 ft18"><SPAN class="ft17">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Again, that’s a matter that probably should’ve been directed in the question period to His Worship. It’s a matter of…falls under his budget and though it was part of the budget, many things are part of the budget in terms of what we approve in terms of the various departments, but it was clearly an item pertaining to the Mayor’s Office.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question has to do with the budget process for 2014. You know, I spend a lot of time in my office and I hear what’s going on, it's very obvious to me that EPC members are working on the budget. Over the last number of weeks they’ve made comments about it that it's being worked quite extensively, the AT decision came out of that and other things, so I guess what I…I’m wondering what your timeline is going to be on the 2014 budget, but I also find it curious that decisions, all these decisions are being made about the budget before the consultation report has come forward, like how does the consultation fit in with the budget process that’s happening upstairs in informal EPC or wherever that’s happening.</P>
<P class="p34 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>I thank Council Gerbasi for the question. It's no different than any given year in the past, we, the work, the departments actually work on the budget ahead of time as the Councillor knows, but we want public consultation process to feed into the budget process. There is a hope that we will be able to bring the budget forward for consideration. I don't think this is…this has been explained in the past or mentioned in the past for consideration before the year is out and to try do, you know, as we’ve done in the past, the combined budgets, what we did this year, the capital and the operating, but you know that, that’s going to be a challenge, but nonetheless the consultation is going to feed into that process and no decisions have been made with regards to the budget and that is a decision that would be made later in the fall.</P>
<P class="p31 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>So, just to make sure I understand you’re right. So you’re saying that you’re expecting probably a draft budget to be tabled in time to be voted on by December, in middle of December, whatever in 2013, for 2014.</P>
<P class="p53 ft10"><SPAN class="ft9">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>That’s…Mr. Speaker, I think it was very clear during the budget discussion that we had in the votes, that we had in January…the goal was in January when the budget was tabled then to try to have…to work on a calendar year and that still remains the goal. Hopefully, we can achieve it, but we'll see. I mean, it’s…when you’re doing both budgets at the same time, it’s a big challenge, our staff is…our Public Service are tremendous, they’ve been working very hard, but we’re taking the consultation information as well as it’s coming forward and so the information that’s…and the survey which will be coming to report to Council in the fall is very useful and an important part of the budget process.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further questions for Finance? Well, ladies and gentlemen, we'll ask for a motion to adjourn. School's out. Roll call.</P>
