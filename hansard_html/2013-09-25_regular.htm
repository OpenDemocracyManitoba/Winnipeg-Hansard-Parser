<P class="p7 ft1">INTRODUCTION AND WELCOME OF GUESTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</P>
<P class="p6 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Well, we’d like to welcome any guests we have in the gallery today. We’re also joined by some folks from the Cancer Awareness Month and Mr. Mayor, I think you have some comments to make.</P>
<P class="p8 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mr. Mayor: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning members of Council and members of the community joined me to raise a flag to recognize September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Childhood cancer is the most common <NOBR>disease-related</NOBR> cause of death among Canadian children. The Canadian Cancer Society estimates that in 2013, over 1400 children under the age of 19 will be diagnosed with cancer. The diagnosis of childhood cancers is often delayed as there are no effective screening tests to detect the early signs of cancer in children and symptoms are difficult to recognize. With some forms of cancer, such as sarcomas, symptoms are often mistaken for harmless growing pains. While there has been much research into childhood cancer, much more must be done to find better ways to detect, diagnose and treat the disease. Today, members of Council are wearing gold ribbons to show our support for the brave children and their families who are courageously facing cancer. I invite all Winnipeggers to join me and my colleagues in wishing strength and hope to all of our young citizens affected by childhood cancer. They and their families are not alone in their fight. I would now like to Erin Crawford, Director of Public Policy for the Canadian Cancer Society to speak. She will be joined by Alli Minarik, <NOBR>co-founder</NOBR> of the Courage <NOBR>Rocks-on</NOBR> Campaign. Alli’s son, Aleksei fought and survived a Ewing’s Sarcoma in 2011 and thankfully remains cancer free.</P>
<P class="p9 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Ladies.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p10 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Erin Crawford: </SPAN>Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here today to mark Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. My name is Erin Crawford and I’m here for the Canadian Cancer Society. You’re going to hear from Alli about her family’s story and her son, Aleksei’s story. Even one story, like Aleksei’s is too many. We don’t know a lot about childhood cancer, about what makes cancer develop in one child and not in another one, but there are things we can all do to help. Alli is doing it by being here today and sharing her story and promoting awareness of childhood cancer and its symptoms and what families should be watching for. The Cancer Society is doing it by investing in childhood cancer research, and we know that those of you around this table are also part of the solution already. Your decision to ban smoking on playing fields where children are present was a huge win for childhood cancer prevention. Reducing exposure to carcinogens in children when their cells are rapidly growing and changing is thought to be one of the primary ways to reduce cancer incidents in children. So today, we thank you for marking this month and for the decisions that you’ve already made to help alleviate childhood cancer. We know there’s more that we all can be doing and at some point, the Cancer Society will be talking to you about additional measures related to shade and UV prevention, but for today, we’re just happy to be here to mark this and to promote awareness because we are all part of the answer. We must continue to fight it every at every front so that fewer kids have to travel Alli’s family’s path. Thank you very much.</P>
<P class="p9 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Alli.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p11 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Alli Minarik: </SPAN>Thank you. Mayor Katz, members of Council, Ms Crawford and guests. I apologize first of all to those of you who’ve already heard the speech outside. When our son Aleksei was 12 years old, a tumour was discovered growing in and around the nerve rootlets at the base of his spine. Three days later, Aleksei was in surgery to have it removed. Ten hours later most of it was gone. That was December 3, 2010. What followed was 46 agonizing days of waiting to hear what kind of cancer our son had. On January 18, what we feared most was confirmed. Aleksei was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma of the spine. A malignant cancer, there is no cure for and one that would only grant my</P>

<P class="p15 ft9">boy a 70% chance of surviving five years. There is nothing that prepares a parent for this kind of news. Sleepless nights and tearful days ensued as the feeling of utter despair sank deep into our souls. Still, however frightening, it didn’t take long for the reality of our situation to become very clear and we switched our focus to the matter at hand, making sure everything was done to ensure Aleksei beat cancer. We found in ourselves strength and determination that we were unaware we possessed. But far more than that, we looked to Aleksei who, with such courage, led us into this battle, never asking “why me” and never complaining. He showed us how to wake up every morning and take on whatever day, whatever that day presented. Aleksei believed from day one that this was just a stumbling block and that he would be cured. After enduring eight months of chemotherapy treatments which required alternating stays in the hospital of five and three days every two weeks and five weeks of radiation to his spine, Aleksei is considered cancer free. Next month will be two years since then and Aleksei continues to grow not only in size but also as a person, a person who at a very tender age had to learn just how fragile life can be. He is 15 years old, a grade 10 student at St. Pauls’ High School, plays hockey and football and most importantly remains cancer free. Our gratefulness for this knows no boundaries. Sadly though there are many kids whose stories don’t end the same as Aleksei’s, and so I feel compelled to do what I can to raise awareness of Ewing’s Sarcoma. Ewing’s Sarcoma is a small round blue cell cancer that can manifest in any bone in the body and soft tissue. The symptoms of Ewing’s Sarcoma vary but they are often reported as bone and/or muscle pain that may come and go and vary in intensity. Because Ewing’s Sarcoma most often targets children and teenagers, these types of complaints are often chalked up to be growing pains or a sports injury leaving this relentless cancer to spread throughout the body. The chance of survival greatly improves if the disease is localized. When left alone to grow Ewing’s Sarcoma can and will spread throughout the body, decreasing a 70% chance of surviving five years to lower than 20%. Courage Rocks On is my awareness campaign and is taking place in various Winnipeg businesses throughout September, Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. My main goal through Courage Rocks On is to make sure people are aware of the symptoms of Ewing’s Sarcoma so that in a child with this deadly disease, it is diagnosed before having had a chance to spread. After September, I hope to find a way to spread this awareness throughout doctors’ offices, physiotherapists, chiropractic and massage therapy clinics. Too often the symptoms of Ewing’s Sarcoma are not recognized, even by our health care professionals until it is too late. Childhood cancer is the number one cause of death in our children aside from accidents. To a mother of a child diagnosed with cancer, it is not rare and to suggest that only results in taking the spotlight away from our kids who are fighting for survival every day. Suggesting childhood cancer is rare disrespects the memories of children we have lost because of it and their families who are left behind. Since Aleksei’s diagnosis, I have grown close to or become aware of six local teenagers also diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, not to mention kids from all over the world all of whom deserve our research dollars to help find a cure. When it comes to cancer, people like to talk numbers and since 36 kids diagnosed a day and the deaths of 2,400 kids every year is considered small, childhood cancer gets the “rare” stamp. Suggesting that we are curing 80% of kids diagnosed with cancer, but leaving out the fact that almost that same percentage of kids have life- long health problems, gives people an excuse to think we are doing pretty good. Myself and many childhood cancer advocates around the world do not consider these numbers to be pretty good. We feel they are outrageous and until people from outside of our community start to acknowledge that those numbers, start to acknowledge that those numbers will not change. I’m sure everyone will agree that the loss of one child is too many. To lose a child means to lose an entire lifetime of potential we will never have the privilege of seeing unfold. An unnamed author once wrote, “Children with cancer are like candles in the wind; who accept the possibility that they are in danger of becoming extinguished by a gust of wind from nowhere and yet, as they flicker and dance to remain alive, their brilliance challenges, the darkness and dazzles those of us who watch their light.” Rest in Peace Darah. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p16 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Alli. We appreciate you attending today. Have a good afternoon. Thank you. We have one individual who will be a delegation on three different items apparently, but before we invite that I’d like to address another issue and it's with regard to order and decorum here in the Council Chamber. As Speaker, I’m responsible for that and I’ll speak directly to Councillor Smith as I look across the Chamber floor and I offered you a mulligan two weeks ago, Councillor Smith, but I wasn't expecting a mocking. So, I will respectfully ask you to take a moment to think about your position and whether or not your attire is appropriate for the Council Chamber and I’ve got as good a sense of humour as the next guy but I don't think what you are wearing today is appropriate and I will ask you to remove it or leave the Chamber.</P>
<P class="p17 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I’ll abide by your ruling, but I do want the people of Winnipeg to realize what I have done and that these <NOBR>t-shirts</NOBR> are available from my office. They can buy them for $10.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>I hope they’re going to a charity.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>So I just want people to realize that. I’m fighting for the people in my area and the people from Corydon and River Heights who have the worst back lanes in the City of Winnipeg, but I’ll gladly abide by your ruling.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>We got that message, thank you very much, sir. Appreciate your <NOBR>co-operation.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p23 ft1">DELEGATIONS</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>All right, we now have a delegation from Mr. Sanders, if you’d like to join us. You have ten minutes, sir on your first one regarding brown water.</P>
<P class="p24 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">David Sanders: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mayor Katz, members of City Council. My name is David Sanders and I’m appearing today as a private citizen to speak in opposition to the particular motion before you regarding brown water damage claims, in favour of the motion regarding the audit of the expenditures of the Mayor's Office and Council Committee Chairs’ discretionary funds, and in favour of referral of the proposed Bicycle Parade Traffic <NOBR>By-Law</NOBR> amendment back for redrafting. With regard to the first item, the Executive Policy Committee, motion with respect to brown water laundry damage claims. EPC is proposing that quote, “The Winnipeg Public Service do all things necessary to reimburse legitimate laundry damage claims caused by brown water.” In my opinion, this is a totally inadequate and meaningless response to a completely unacceptable situation. And just what do you expect the City claims department to do any differently than what they are now doing? I understand that citizens claims for damage is related to the brown water coming from their taps are being rejected now because first of all, the city says its water testing program confirms that the water is safe and continues to comply with the operating licence issued by the Provincial Office of Drinking Water, Manitoba Regulations and the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality, but Section 485, Sub 3 of the City of Winnipeg Charter Act states that, and I quote, "The City is not liable for damages caused by the quality or content of water supplied by the City unless the water does not meet accepted standards of purity established under provincial regulations respecting health." If so, will there be any quote, "legitimate claims to pay”? I doubt it. If Council really wishes to make <NOBR>ex-gracia</NOBR> payments to citizens and/or businesses who can provide acceptable evidence of damages or financial losses caused by the brown water emitted from their taps you should immediately call the City Solicitor, the Manager of the Corporate Risk Management Department, or the Director of Water and Waste and get them to come over to the Council Building and prepare a revised motion which will actually achieve EPC’s Policy intentions and not just mislead and probably disappoint the many potential claimants. If these individuals have been thinking about the issue at all, they should be able to provide you with a much better motion before the end of this meeting for you to adopt. For your information, as once Executive Director of the Manitoba Water Commission, but that certainly doesn't make me an expert on drinking water quality. But I don't have to be an expert to tell you that while the brown water may or may not be healthy, it is definitely not acceptable to Winnipeggers, and from reviewing some of the information available including the Canadian Guidelines and Manitoba Regulations and the City's reported water quality test results, the persistent emitting of discoloured brown water with sedimentation especially through hot water systems may be caused by elevated levels of manganese appearing in the City’s water supply between the Shoal Lake aqueduct and their local distribution system and if the City has had a consultant studying this for a year, where is the report? And please, do have the City and staff and 311 operators stop brushing off complainants with lame excuses and insulting advice to accept the dirty water. I thought of asking each Councillor to try the Erin Brockovich test this morning and drink some of the brown water. That shouldn't be necessary and though I brought some, I’m advised beverages are not allowed in the Council Chamber, you are safe. On the second item, the Executive Policy Committee, notice of motion regarding the audited expenditures of the Mayor Office and Council Committee Chairs. I do urge Council to adopt the proposed motion, which would direct the City Auditor to provide a comprehensive review of the expenditures of the Mayor's Office and Council Committee Chairs expenditures of discretionary funds starting with 2013 as this year, January 1. On June 5th of this year, Council referred a similar motion to establish expenditures criteria for the Mayor's Office, Executive Policy Committee and communication functions and it was referred to the Governance Committee of Council, but as far as I can tell, there’s been no further public action on this matter. After significant expenditures are made this spring on the outrageous Responsible Winnipeg <NOBR>astro-turf</NOBR> advertising campaign, and with 2014 being a civic election year, is it too much to hope that these matters will finally be dealt with, soon? Thirdly, the report of the Standing Policy Committee on Protection and Community Services regarding the bicycle parade amendment to the Winnipeg Traffic <NOBR>By-Law,</NOBR> I have attached for your information, a copy of my presentation to EPC explaining why the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> ought not to be approved as drafted. I do support to propose motion to refer the matter for redrafting although I would much prefer that the proposed amendment be rejected outright and that Legal Services be directed to produce a revised draft amendment, which will accomplish the explicit aim of allowing cyclists to become a parade if they so wish but not compel them to do so and I have to say I am not impressed with the fact that the proposed amendment was approved by the CAO and Winnipeg Police Service in consultation with Legal Services and Public Works and since the problem has been obvious for at least two weeks, I would’ve thought that Legal Services could’ve produced a better draft amendment for consideration by now instead of sending the matter off into never, never land. And I do have to say, there are a great many other issues which deserve debate and action now but do not appear on this agenda. Promised audit reports, promised operational reviews, a written budget consultation, update, a detailed review of best practices and the delegations of financial authority and measures to establish a City of Winnipeg Code of Conduct Committee and disclosure process, all of which was at the, and the last item, the code of conduct there was actually passed by this Council in 2001, 12 years ago. Why are none of the reports on these matters being delivered to Council on time as directed? Thank you, Mr. Chairman and that will be all of my comments.</P>

<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to make a few comments about this seeing as this is a new housing policy that the Mayor asked me to chair, the Housing Steering Committee a year ago, November, whenever it was and I wanted to thank the Mayor for that. I wanted to thank Councillors Vandal and Pagtakhan who sit on the Winnipeg Housing Steering Committee. I wanted to point out as everyone knows that the issue of affordable housing, in particular rental at this point in time is a huge issue across the city. There are many issues across the city in terms of the need for revitalization in areas, affordability and many other issues. I’d like to also thank the staff that worked on this project, Winston Yee and Dave Dessens from the Housing Branch and the Property and Development. I wanted to point out that in January of 2012, a motion was approved at the Housing Steering Committee which was supported by Council to undertake a public consultation with other levels of government and the community at large, to draft a new housing policy for review and approval by Council and that is what we are doing at this point in time today.</P>

<P class="p22 ft1">September 25, 2013</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">There was, I just wanted a couple of quick comments, just so you are aware. There was a broad public consultation with community groups throughout the City that were stakeholder groups, industry, multiple levels of government, were aware and part of developing this policy and having input into it. The policy provides a framework. It’s not a bunch of programs. It’s simply a policy frame work at this stage to ensure that critical and relevant housing items can be addressed. As many of you know, we had our first real major housing policy in about 2000, Councillor Vandal and some other…Councillor Smith and Pagtakhan remember, and over those years we had a situation back then where we were losing our tax base drastically. We still face those problems in parts of the city. We still face new and emerging problems as well. So, this policy is an investment in our city. It's not just…it's not about just let's spend a bunch of money on our...it's also about investing that money to create a tax base; to create healthier communities; to deal with the issues that our citizens face in terms of finding a place to live throughout the city. The policy speaks to partnerships; you know the City has a certain role in housing. Every city in Canada and community in Canada are facing the same kind of issues with a lack of affordable accommodation and the City may not be…is certainly not the only…we are one partner in this and other levels of government have a major role, and then…but we all have to work together and we have to have clear policy in place so that we can deal with those issues. The policy that we have from 2000 has been updated and is reflective of the current housing environment. So it basically, it's not taking away from anything that has been done, it's recognizing what’s been done building on that and giving us the opportunity, if the political will is there, to move forward with innovative new approaches to addressing our housing issues in partnership with other levels of government, the community and so on. The next steps on this policy are to develop an implementation plan and that's where the rubber is going to hit the road in terms of the details and in terms of what we put into our budgets and what programs we put in place. So that's going to happen over the next six months. And I just…I think it's totally a positive thing. We have to have a sound policy basis for moving forward. We are doing a lot of different…we have done a lot of different kinds of programs in the downtown, in targeted areas. I think we have to focus our rare, scarce resources on the areas that need it most and on the problems that are the most urgent; that things that would not be happening in the private sector unless there’s some <NOBR>broad-based</NOBR> strategy working in partnership with all levels of government and the community to address these kind of complex problems and the result of doing that and the good work that was started in 2000 is that our tax base in some neighbourhoods has really improved. It's been an investment that has paid off even if you just look at the dollars. It also has paid off if you look at the quality of life. But that doesn't change that there is a huge amount more to do in terms of affordable rental housing crisis that we and most communities in Canada are facing. So we…so that's what this policy does. It doesn't commit us any of the programs that come forward will have to come back here and be reviewed by Council. So, you’re not signing off on any specific thing although I kind of wish we were but, in the next six months, there will be an implementation plan that will come forward and that's where the rubber will hit the road in terms of this Council's commitment to addressing the affordable housing crisis, particularly in rental and then all affordable housing across the city that we are facing. And I don’t want…and this does not lose sight of the work that’s currently being done in our housing improvement zones in other areas. Those groups are very much a part of this going forward. Those communities and where the need is, is where we have to focus our scarce dollars as well as looking at creative ways to revitalize our downtown and other issues that we are facing and affordable housing doesn't all have to be in one place, it can be throughout the city. And ultimately, it’s the other levels of government that we are also…I also just want to mention Winnipeg is the manager, so to speak, of the housing and homelessness initiative of the federal government, and so we are administrating that for the federal government and that is focusing on some specific options like housing first and other projects that have come forward some of the good projects that the Mayor has been at announcements for and so on and so we do have some support there happening in Winnipeg. There’s other strategies that are interrelated and ultimately, I just thought I put in a plug for the CEO Sleepout that’s happening on Thursday, Councillor Havixbeck and myself are participating from Council so feel free to send in your support for that. That is about raising funds for, to address homelessness, particularly in our downtown through raising some funds for specific employment programs and housing options for those individuals in the downtown and working on that strategy as well as raising awareness so that's just another thing that’s a little bit related I thought I’d mention and thank you very much for your support on this and I hope that the support is unanimous, regardless of…I know there’s always some naysayers in certain media outlets about this but I think this is obviously important to have very good policies in place moving forward as a Council. So thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Councillor Gerbasi. Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p38 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yes, Mr. Speaker. I support this clause wholeheartedly. Let me tell you, yesterday, I picked up a newspaper and I read Tom Brodbeck's column, where he attacked all of us and this policy. He said cities should leave affordable housing to province, feds and focus on providing core service. I believe housing is one of the core services. You know, a neighbourhood is not just roads, back lanes. It's a community with homes, parks and people have to have reasonable living conditions. Every city, major city in Canada, deals with housing issues. We're not the only one with a housing policy. How does it help our city to have sections run down? How does it help our city to increase the number of homeless people? This policy is a good policy and I hope it leads to action in the future to deal with some of the things it is suggesting. I hope we would be unanimous on this. It's really worthwhile for us to support this wholeheartedly. It's an investment in every part of our city where housing is not up to scratch. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Pagtakhan.</P>
<P class="p43 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’ll be quick. This is just a good news story I want to share with the Council here and the citizens of Winnipeg. This is the first…what's happening here is a land dedication. Monies going towards a community garden at 785 Keewatin Street, Mr. Speaker, and what this is, it’s the first community food centre in Manitoba, in western Canada. It’s a movement that kind of started in eastern Canada. Basically, a community food centre is a welcoming space where people come together to grow, cook, share and advocate for good food, Mr. Speaker. The CFCs provide people with emergency access to high quality food in a dignified setting that doesn't compromise their <NOBR>self-worth.</NOBR> People learn cooking and gardening skills there and kids get their hands dirty in the garden and kitchen in ways that expand their taste buds and help them make healthier food choices. Community members find their voices on the issues that matter to them and people find friends and support. Mr. Speaker, CFCs offer multifaceted, integrated and responsive programming in a shared space where food builds health, hope, skills and community. This is a very exciting project. The community gardens are going to be located, Mr. Speaker, on city owned lands, the Shaughnessy Park, green space and it’s going to be very extensive project and this 10,000 dollars that’s going there is really, really needed. I want to thank my colleagues on LSWK, Councillor Sharma and Eadie for supporting it as well as the Mayor and Executive Policy and I hope it gets the resounding support of Council.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p45 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>I support this wholeheartedly. You know, it doesn't meet criteria in the sense that it’s not on public land. It's not on public land but it’s an amazing effort, uniting the community to garden, to cook and to work together to provide meals. It really is a worthwhile effort. They plan to involve 500 residents each week making 200 free healthy meals. This is better than a food bank. Food banks do not encourage a sense of community; this does. Community Food Centres of Canada are giving 150,000 to this project. They are also having another efforts in other cities similar to this. An anonymous donor is giving 100,000. And the request for funding from the land dedication reserve is 10,000. So this really is a win situation and we should all be supporting this. It's incredible. You know, everything together makes a lot of sense. They garden; they produce food; they cook it; they get information and it will be useful for that community and it's not just for that community, it's also open to people from other parts of the city to come there as well, so this is a great project. It’s one that we should wholeheartedly be supporting.</P>

<P class="p47 ft1">Item 6 – Brown Water Laundry Damage Claims</P>
<P class="p33 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think at this particular point in time, all members of Council are aware of the issue of brown water. I believe everyone has received a letter from Diane Sacher, the director. I’m just going to read the first paragraph. It's to Mayor and Councillors. “As you know, this August, the City of Winnipeg has received an unusually high number of calls from our customers regarding discoloured water. Please be assured we are taking the situation very seriously. We understand that customers expect clear water and resolving the issue for Winnipeggers is of the utmost priority for us. We’re doing everything we can to address this issue as quickly and effectively as possible and in addition to our own internal resources, we have engaged outside expertise which includes the foremost water quality experts in North America. Representatives are in Winnipeg examining data and undertaking analysis. While the number of calls has declined significantly in the last few weeks, finding a solution remains a priority and we are continuing our investigations and analysis. Please be assured that we remain committed to finding a resolution to this issue." Mr. Speaker, as you are aware at the last EPC meeting, there was a motion moved by Councillor Vandal. I believe the raison d’étre of that motion is that there are citizens who have suffered legitimate damages and the intent of the motion, I believe, was to basically make sure that we address those as opposed to hiding behind the charter and saying you know what, the water is drinkable, we are not liable, which is accurate and correct, but I think there is legal and there is moral and I believe that Councillor Vandal was looking at it from what is morally right and what should we be doing. In addition to that, and I think everybody has seen the motion. We did have a meeting earlier this week with the director with legal, with the COO, as well as Risk Management, to basically have them adjust the motion so we have some details in it to what qualifies and give it some meat to it, which will I’m sure is the process that will happen and at that point in time, I think we should be fair and objective as opposed to taking that stamp and just going “reject, reject, reject, reject”, because the realities are of approximately 57 claims that came in that first week, they were all rejected, Mr. Speaker. So that's the intent of the motion and I’d be happy to hear from other members of Council.</P>
<P class="p48 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes, thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I was hoping that we could move…to move this item back to Executive Policy Committee at this time.</P>

<P class="p33 ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: <SPAN class="ft2">Yeah.</SPAN></P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p49 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>So as it stands here, we have a motion and it is admirable that the Executive Policy Committee has brought it forward. I appreciate what is going on with our water in the city and I can appreciate how hard Diane Sacher and all of her staff have been working. In <NOBR>Charleswood-Tuxedo</NOBR> alone, we've had over 1800 addresses with problems. I can tell you that I've heard from constituents who have spent thousands of dollars on replacing bedding, linens, clothing. As this motion is however, we have no idea how much this will actually cost the City of Winnipeg and to what magnitude where…and what parameters we are going to have on this. And so my motion to refer it back to Executive Policy Committee is to simply get some clarification and a report back and there is no administration…administrative report here. Adopting this is blindly adopting something and it’s like throwing a dart in a dark room and hoping that it hits something. And I think that in these times, when we are in the midst of putting a budget together. We don't know what that’s going to look like, I think it would only be prudent to at least have some ballpark of what this will cost taxpayers, so that's my reason for the motion.</P>
<P class="p50 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Mayor Katz, you have three minutes.</P>
<P class="p51 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the comments from the Councillor but to be very frank with you, this is exactly what was addressed with our administration and all those individuals I said, to come up with one. I think you can realistically assume, I know Mr. Speaker, I do laundry, I’m sure you have to. You can only put so much laundry …I mean I don’t…I can't recall ever having my laundry be worth thousands of dollars, okay so let's be realistic. We know what normally goes in there and they want to put some parameters on it. I think the best qualified for this would be the administration, along with the type of proof because there will be an onus to verify things. It's not just a matter of saying, carte blanche, that's number one. Number two, Mr. Speaker, for some people and let's be frank here. If you did your laundry and it was ruined, and it was worth $160 in that particular instance or $80, okay. That may not be a whole lot of money to the Councillor but to that individual, it May mean everything. So I think we can put a little faith in the people from Claims, from Legal, the COO, as well as the director to come up with something that is fair and reasonable, Mr. Speaker. This will not be millions of dollars, Mr. Speaker. That's not the case. It's a matter of treating every citizen fairly. And the onus is upon them to show us that they have suffered damages, just like any insurance claim, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p52 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All right, we'll call the question on the referral. If it's defeated, then we will take other speakers on the item. So all those in favour of referring Item 6 back to EPC, please rise. Okay. All those opposed?</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">A RECORDED VOTE </SPAN>was taken the result being as follows:</P>
<P class="p53 ft1">Yeas</P>
<P class="p54 ft2">Councillors Havixbeck, Orlikow and Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p55 ft1">Nays</P>
<P class="p19 ft2">His Worship Mayor Katz, Councillors Browaty, Eadie, Fielding, Gerbasi, Mayes, Pagtakhan, Sharma, Smith, Steen, Swandel, Vandal. Mr. Speaker Councillor Nordman.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">City Clerk: </SPAN>The vote Mr. Speaker, Yeas 3, Nays 13.</P>
<P class="p56 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Motion is defeated, so we will stay on item 6. Mayor Katz if you would like to open again. It's already open okay. Councillor Vandal had his hand up, so you’re next.</P>
<P class="p24 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, never before has the difference between governing and administration been so profound for me. We’re all very frustrated because of this discoloured water, brown water situation. We know that it's been here for many years, we know that it spikes in the summer. I’ve been telling my constituents and I think many of us have, that if you have damages to your laundry you should make a claim. I was told to tell my constituents that. Over 50 people made claims, they all got rubber stamp refusals one after the other. Sorry, it’s in the Charter, no responsibility. We can't help you. At that point, I spoke to Executive Committee and we made a decision that we think that it’s…that's not a fair answer for our constituents and we need to give direction, governance direction, which is the role of politicians, to actually get something done. So what we are approving this morning, Mr. Speaker is a governance go ahead and the motion is very short, very sweet, after some discussion that the Winnipeg public service do all things necessary to reimburse legitimate laundry damage caused by brown water. We're not talking about water tanks; we’re not talking about extra detergent; we’re not talking about bottled water; we’re talking about laundry that's legitimately caused by our brown water. Now, we have…I would hazard a guess at least a couple of dozen claims officers that work for the City of Winnipeg, that work all day long, week after week to administer claims. It's going to be their job to put some criteria</P>

<P class="p57 ft4">around how this is going to be administered, Mr. Speaker. They’re going to do some financial projections and they’re going to talk about what's legitimate, what's not, what's the burden of evidence that constituents are going to have to demonstrate. And they’re going to administer the program after a political decision that's made here this morning, Mr. Speaker, and that's our role is to take action, especially in extraordinary circumstances and I would argue that this is just that, an extraordinary circumstance, Mr. Speaker. Essentially, there was a meeting yesterday with Legal, with the Claims Department, with senior administration that talked about that criteria and yes, they are going to put criteria together and yes, they are going to consult with the chair of Public Works. They’re going to consult with the Mayor and they’re likely to consult with all of Council on getting this done, Mr. Speaker. And if they hit a brick wall, then the report’s going to come forward and it's going to be considered by my committee and Executive Committee and this Council on how we tear down that brick wall to administer, I think, what we want to do here. And the thought base is very clear, it’s very simple, couldn't be any shorter. Sometimes less is better. Do all things necessary to reimburse legitimate laundry damage claims caused by brown water. We have an administration to do this. Let them work.</P>
<P class="p50 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p58 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That was very well said by Councillor Vandal and I want to commend Councillor Vandal for bringing this motion forward at EPC. A few months ago, I had called for a review of the “Know Your Zone” snow clearing policy and Councillor Eadie said to me, “Brave political decision coming out against more snowfall”, which was a good line I have to say, and there is some of that here which is we're all against more brown water. We’d all like to see the problem solved. The one concrete thing I think we’ve been doing in terms of changing existing policy is this motion where we said, as Councillor Vandal said, we’re not going to keep <NOBR>rubber-stamping,</NOBR> denying all claims; we're going to take a look at them and judge them on their merits, get some funding going. The Mayor said there is legal and there’s moral. As an <NOBR>ex-lawyer,</NOBR> I would like to think there is at least some overlap there, but clearly here our legal position was we could’ve denied under the Charter, we’re choosing not to do that we are making what’s called ex gratia or gratuitous payments out to people because I think that's the right thing to do and the motion speaks to that. So, what are the details? Those are going to have to be worked out. There was a meeting yesterday to start trying to hammer out how many claims, the dollar amount, is there a cap? Is there a total fund? All those decisions need to be made but I for one, didn't want to wait a couple of months and have a series of internal meetings about that. Let's get the principal in place, let’s get it sent people the message we’re doing something. As I went around door to door this summer, I know I’d had people, I was making notes here, in the 100 block of Riel, people on Metz, people on Vista saying to me, “You know, this is an issue. I’ve had this problem.” It wasn't huge dollar amounts maybe but it was a genuine concern for people and they felt they’d been mistreated by the City in just having their claim denied so I’m pleased to see some concrete action being taking. We'll get…we’ll get the claims staff working on this; get the details worked out and get some money flowing to people. It's not all water related matters. It’s not, as Councillor Vandal said the hot water tanks, it’s not the bottled water but it is something. It’s something real. It reimburses people and I think it's the right thing to do.</P>
<P class="p59 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thank you very much. This is…again, we all know this brown water issue. We don't know why it's happening but it reflects poorly on all of us. There’s no way around it. The City must provide clean water. We haven't for whatever reasons and looking for it, we all are in the city. Now, so that throws out the moral debate. Well, I find the moral debate very significant and emotional. It's very nice. Around this table we can have many moral debates about housing. Should we help people have a roof over their head or not? We just had that little moral debate. Some of us view no, some of you, yes. There’s lots of moral debates we can have. And morally, I agree that we all need to reimburse people for our failure, why ever it happens. So I agree with that. The problem that I see though, and I’m very concerned about it, is a Pandora's Box on this one. We have now decided to break policy; to remove ourselves out of the Charter and say we are responsible, even though the Charter protects us, so we're saying we're just responsible for laundry only. That's all we're responsible for because that's what it says there. I haven’t been privy to these conversations that have happened as of yesterday. You know, the presenter here today wasn't privy to those conversations that happened yesterday as well. So my concern though is, is it are we opening up a Pandora's Box? Sure, we don't know exactly the amount of cost would be for this, but legitimate damages, just remove laundry. Now we're back to legitimate damages. I don't know the legal. Maybe the legal has said, “Oh, we're totally fine”, like they said that with regarding our legal opinion regarding selling water to municipalities. We're okay, we can do this, it’s no problem, Maybe they said this won't create a precedent. I don't know. Again, wasn't a member of that conversation, but why is it legitimate for laundry and not legitimate for that person who can't drink that water? They are legitimate just because we put the word laundry there? Does that mean that resolves any kind of legal challenge that we’re going to have to this or have we, maybe opened this door up for legal challenges. Again, Maybe the Mayor can tell me about this, they…hopefully had this conversation with Legal, but I think it’s…to me, it's a very scary door that we're opening up. We know our financial problems in this city right now, they are astronomical. We have so much more investment we need to be doing. How much time would this take up administratively? How many claims will come in? All these things are very, very terrifying for us and they should be. We don't have a huge surplus of staff kicking around right now that will be able</P>

<P class="p63 ft2">to handle extra work loads so how are we going to manage this? Again we’ve said “trust us, we'll figure it out, we’ll be okay, we’ll trust, just trust us”. Again, I’m not that readily easily to trust when something like this, has such a huge impact on our system. So, with much reservation, I am, I’ve made my comments known; hopefully I can get some legal kind of perspective on this. I am still at this point undecided.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Yes, Mr. I wasn't going to speak on this, Councillor Vandal is handling it well and I heard much support the motion before us today. You know, but when Councillor Orlikow had made some very good comments from his some point of view. I had a situation in my ward in 2007 where we had the City claim responsibility. There was a flood that happened essentially where raw sewage spilled into about 60 houses down Assiniboine Avenue as people were doing nothing wrong and there was some issues in terms of opening and closing some of the drainage that were there. At the end of the day, you know, you had 60 people that were flooded out with raw sewage coming up their toilets, their sinks and everything else like this. We had, you know, City meeting we had, Mr. Mike Ruta at that point and came out and addressed everyone at that point and there was a discrepancy between what we can…what we can approve, I guess in terms of the insurance claims but with situations like this when happen, I think you’ve got to evaluate the criteria that’s before us and so we made some decisions where we went above and beyond what the City was responsible for just in terms of insurance items that’s there. I think this is somewhat similar to a case that we are talking about people if there are, there’s some problems in terms of their laundry. I think it’s acceptable. I think administration coming back with some parameters for it so it’s not going to cost us millions of dollars but if there’s a reasonable amount of money that people can be compensated for, for reasonable claims and claims that you know aren’t, you don’t want to think people take advantage of the situation that’s there, I think it's something that can be handled on a financial basis in a manageable way that makes sense for our citizens. So I think when situations like this happen, you’ve got to look outside the box and I’m very supportive of what Councillor Vandal is doing just because of some previous experience, we had and we went a little bit further than what the City had to say because we’re listening to what some of our constituents are saying. So I’m very supportive of it and I want to see what administration comes back in terms of the parameters of what this will take a look at you know, in terms of how you’re going to compensate people and I’m confident that they’re going to come up with a fair process that everyone can support.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind everybody that the motion in front of us is that the Winnipeg Public Service do all things necessary to reimburse legitimate laundry damage claims caused by brown water. There’s no criteria in here whatsoever. Referral back isn’t going to solve this problem. The reality is and it's good thing Councillor Fielding brought up the example he did because I think that is sort of where this issue lies. In the case that Councillor Fielding brought up, there was an argument over whether a gate was left open or left closed. The reality of the situation with brown water and I've experienced it in my own home last year. Doesn’t happen this year, I don't know what the miracle is that made it happen or miracle is that made it go away, but if you look at the material that is provided by our water and waste folks, they tell you it's going to happen everywhere. It’s indiscriminate. That’s because sediment collects in our pipes. When you look at other cities, they all have some kind of commentary on sediment in pipes and discolouration of water. It’s something that’s going to impact all of us at some point in our lives being users of a municipal water system. You can't start saying, “Okay, we're going to pay for this, we’re going to pay for that one.” We can’t start setting these precedents. We can't do that. It just makes no sense because ultimately, it's not the City of Winnipeg that pays; it’s the ratepayers and the taxpayers of the City of Winnipeg that pays. We're already sharing the burden. We don't need to do this. So you know, I just would encourage you all to be strong. Let's not try to appease you know, some discomfort in the public there for the sake of our own political <NOBR>well-being.</NOBR> The reality is, we don't need to do this. We, as the citizens of the City of Winnipeg, are already paying for this and we all will at some point when they flush your pipes or when major construction happens on your street. Read the material. It's not big lots, it’s not small lots, it’s not rich people, it’s not poor people, it's everyone. We're already paying for it. It's a fact of having a water system and it's not just in Winnipeg. I think there’s probably if you look at our dry years is when this happens more. I don't know why that is Maybe people are watering their gardens too much and it’s causing excess flow or you know, their lawns so there’s some excess flush and flow, but this is not good policy. And you know, Councillor Vandal's point at the beginning, the role of Council is to set policy. I would like to see this policy before I set it. I don't know what a legitimate claim is and I don't think there is a legitimate claim here and I think there is a very, very scary precedent for the City by say, just us, as a Council saying we're just going to hand over this definition of legitimate claim because that will be used in the argument of every future case where somebody thinks the City did something wrong. And in this case, it's the citizens' utility, it’s affecting every citizen and they're going to pay for it in their rates or they’re going to pay for it in their taxes. We'll all going to share it somewhere and if you look at the way it's set up, the way it’s happening indiscriminately and it will affect us all at some point, we are already all paying for it. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p57 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Speaker Nordman. I wasn't going to speak on this issue and I’d like to thank Councillor Swandel for sobering the thought in regards to this particular motion because it is indiscriminate as to when brown water does appear. And throughout this process this summer, I’ve heard of…it's not only laundry, I have a woman who insists the water, the brown water that she was using on her garden has damaged her vegetables and so on, and is looking for a claim as well. We have a number of people in my ward who are experiencing brown water. I’m pretty sure, because it happened to us where their sewer separation water main replacement happening in the West Kildonan area. I know that in other years in the past, not necessarily due to flow but when…well, actually due to water flow where there was a fire, about four or five years before I was a City Councillor, there was a fire only about a block or two away and low and behold, all of a sudden there is brown water at my house and usually, and I find it interesting that laundry has been singled out because usually people will see the brown water when they get up in the morning and it's coming out of your sink and they’ll know that the brown water is there and then you really have to decide whether you want to proceed to do your laundry or not. I don't know how random that might be unless somebody you know, gets up and it happens all of a sudden but the circumstances are there. And I think today, I’m actually going to have to vote against this particular motion and I would like to point out about our water this summer that I really did appreciate. I did not taste any algae flavoured water this year at all. So I think that our water system is actually improving and I think that there are consultants who are looking into why this brown water is happening because in some neighbourhoods, new neighbourhoods I heard of one incident out in the Transcona way that they were experiencing brown water. I don't understand why necessarily that can happen but hopefully that can all be solved so I just wanted to say today I will be voting against this motion because it doesn't really cover the broad spectrum of what people's actual losses are due to brown water and it does reduce the life of your hot water tank as well. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p48 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further comments? Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p43 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I think this is a nice gesture and I will be supporting the motion before us here today. The water utility frankly is going to have additional revenues because of all the water people are flushing down the taps are right now to clear their brown water instances so I don't see that it's a huge financial burden in this particular case. My concern though is we still can’t figure out what’s going on here. This is downright an epidemic in my ward at least and we're completely frustrated and ticked off about the ongoing problem. If the public service can't come up with an explanation at least as to why this is happening and why so much more this year, we're completely frustrated and I’m ready to throw up my arms in disappointment and disgust that we can't figure this out. This water is unacceptable. I mean, there’s very few basic elements in life. I’m not a huge environmentalist as I think a lot of people are on this table, no. But when it comes to clean air and clean water, there’s nothing more basic and those are things we absolutely, positively need, so again, I just want to express to all my colleagues how frustrated we are up in northeast Winnipeg. I don’t think this accomplishes much but I will be supporting it.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p43 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, wasn't going to speak on this issue. I had hoped that moving it for referral might get us some more information, and you know I've been listening to everyone around the table and quite honestly, initially I was very supportive of this until I actually thought of about the people who had called me and the magnitudes of the complaints that I had heard and this is not just a recent problem for some. Some people have had this problem from January, from April. I have condo complexes where seniors have done multiple loads of laundry and to minimize it by saying that it could not possibly be thousands of dollars. Yes, it could. If you purchase three sets of bedding, which could easily be a thousand dollars. I can think of five or six people who have replaced their bedding three or four times now. I’m very concerned about the cost and this is just laundry. Somebody raised, I believe Councillor Swandel raised the issue of what is legitimate and what is not legitimate? People have had to replace their hot water tanks. That's an expense, that’s a significant expense for some people. And I just…I, those two pieces for me force me to not support this. What is legitimate? Who are we to decide that and what is the cost of this in these difficult financial times that the City is facing? Thank you.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was going to say if you look at the wording in front of us, it simply says “do all things necessary to reimburse legitimate laundry damages”. So it’s saying that it's a legitimate claim and that if something is legitimate, it should be reimbursed. And then I think we as Councillors are saying or what the motion's intent is saying is that if something is a legitimate claim, it should be considered fairly and the next step is to trust the administration to do their jobs and that seems to be something we’re kind of lacking around here from a number of voices. You know, we are all, yeah, we’re getting phone calls, it's challenging but we have the responsibility to listen to concerns and all …to provide information to our constituents. If you look at the information on the web site which not everybody is going to be on the web site, and fine, like we can tell people if they contact us that you’re not supposed to wash your clothes, you’re not supposed to drink it while it's brown and if it continues to be brown, someone will come out</P>

<P class="p49 ft4">and inspect your pipes. There is a process out there and it's not fun and it's awful. And no one wants to have brown water and none of us want this to be happening but I’m a little concerned about the bashing our department’s getting over this. We are a go between, between our constituents and our department that is trying to deal with this problem and it's getting pretty ugly frankly. I guess it's silly season, a year from an election, but having said all that, this motion that’s in front of us today is simply saying if someone puts in a claim that's legitimate, could the administration make sure that it is considered properly. I don't have a problem saying yes to that. Like let's not blow this into, turn a mountain into, you know, blow this whole thing into out of proportion. But obviously, no one is minimizing the brown water situation. The memo we received from staff is…has some accurate information. It's about communicating to the public. What they are saying is that we do have a state of the art water treatment plant, which is producing beautiful, clean, high quality water. We have a problem in the delivery system that they have hired somebody to look into and I guess, as a community we have to have some patience with this. We have to manage our finances in our city and all the challenges we have and to just assume that no one’s doing their job because there’s a current problem that we’re trying to work on isn't fair to our administration and I think they’re taking a beating. We’re taking a beating as Councillors. The media is worked up about it and so it's an issue that you know, we are trying to deal with, but all I’m saying is what all we're voting on today is to say if there’s a legitimate claim, let's make sure it's considered fairly. That's how I’m reading the motion. I assume the administration will come up with details they can, and that we will be informed about that as a standing committee in Council so that if the criteria come forward and they don't make sense or if there’s problems in the future we can address that with it, but we do have to put some faith in our administration to deal with this brown water problem. I mean, they’re the ones that are going to be dealing with it. They’re the ones that are running the treatment plant and cleaning our pipes and taking care of this for us. And I think in a respectful way, we all have to work together to resolve this, so I am happily, I’m fully prepared to support saying that legitimate claims should be considered. If the administration comes back and says that it’s not legitimate and that whatever the criteria is, we'll have to have that discussion at that time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>I, too, wasn't going to speak on this matter. But now, I am now. Mr. Speaker, no one, no one, I’ve not heard anyone here today bash the department or the public service. I think I've heard a level of frustration. So, for the Councillor for Fort <NOBR>Rouge-East</NOBR> Fort Garry to say that we're bashing water and waste department, I take exception of that. I think there is a serious level of frustration. The reality is Mr. Speaker, we started getting calls about this in August and we started dealing with it as Councillors and in the Public Service as far as August in terms of the wave of calls were starting coming in. The media didn't get into this issue or find out or start reporting on it until September and well into September. And there’s one, I guess I don't know if you would call it a reporter or the national broadcaster who decided to sensationalize this issue and not do the citizens of the city any service whatsoever in terms of sensationalizing this issue, which is really unfortunate in my opinion, Mr. Speaker. But we have not communicated well in terms of the issue and in terms of the level of frustration, and in terms of what the department is doing and in terms of the steps that are being taken. That is the reality and I think our citizens, who we are still getting calls from, are frustrated because when you don't have information you assume the worst, and when you don't have information that is where fear comes from. And when I go home last week and hear that I can't drink my water from my family, because somehow it's dangerous, you know, the water I mean, I’m drinking our water but the reality is, Mr. Speaker, there is a level of frustration and fear and concern from the citizens of Winnipeg because of the lack of information. We need to get the information out. We need to have Councillors more aware of what the department is doing. We need to ensure that our citizens are aware of what's going on. I think the fact that there may not be answers is something that we should not be fearful of saying right now. The fact is they are trying to study, they’re trying to find out what is going on, why the sudden spike has occurred at this point in time. Mr. Speaker, this is in terms of previous years, the amount of calls and the amount of complaints is definitely higher compared to previous years. Something is going on or something…and the department is, is extremely involved and trying to resolve it. Unfortunately, they are engineers, not unfortunately, but they are engineers. I mean we know that, but they’re not paid communication specialists and they don't have them and we're not like the Province where you’ve a massive department of cabcom, cabinet communication, to sit there all day and spin and put information out. You know, we're doing the business of municipal government and they’re trying to find solutions and trying to find answers, and that's the frustrating part because you know in past budget savings and cuts everything, we've actually cut our communications and now we’re seeing how this can kind of backfire. And so, Mr. Speaker, I think the level of frustration is there, nobody is bashing the department. We're trying to find answers. Nobody is more frustrated I think than individual Councillors who are getting calls or talking to constituents who don't have answers. You know, we’d like to be able to give answers to our constituents when they call us and they have questions about municipal government. We don’t have the answers and I think that’s where the frustration is. And I know Councillor Vandal's motivation on his motion was positive. Like he’s trying to, you know, he is reacting to the calls he’s getting and the frustration that he has and so he came forward with a motion that was an idea. You know, and I, so I can't knock him or you know, criticize his motion in that sense. I think his motivation is real and legitimate and you know, in terms of the claims, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to be able to say, yes we should be paying but as Finance Chair, I’m torn right now. You know, in terms of, I mean, we just shut down a program earlier this year in terms of tree roots, right? And</P>

<P class="p65 ft4">because we’re trying to balance a budget and so I just, I’m torn, to tell you the truth in terms of this issue. I know that folks have, or there’s a lot of folks out there who legitimately have had brown water and had it destroy laundry loads and clothes and definitely, they have taken a financial hit, there’s no doubt about it but how we handle this as we go forward, Mr. Speaker, is going to be crucial and I think Councillor Browaty made a good point and that is that it’s just the need to have this information in terms of what is going on and what will potentially solve this problem. Is it a aberration, is it just a one year spike because of the…all of a sudden in August, it got really warm you know, in terms of, and they all of a sudden, people started using water when we all, for two or three months, there was very little because we had a terrible summer up until early August?

<P class="p63 ft14">AND WHEREAS the Mayor’s Office receives funding similar to the Councillors’ Representation Allowance for operation of their office and for discretional items;</P>
<P class="p26 ft14">THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Auditor to include in their annual audit for 2013 and each future year, the expenditures for the Mayor’s Office as well as the Chairmanship monies each member of Executive Policy Committee receives, which is approximately $7,000 each.</P>
<P class="p78 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I’d like to just open with a few brief comments. I’ll have more to say at the closing after everyone has had an opportunity to speak. I just like to speak to why I raised this and brought this forward and I think it's important to first speak to that it has nothing to do with the Mayor personally, has nothing to do with any present or past members of EPC or chairs of who would be affected by this particular budget. But I believe that this is simply something that must be done to ensure we have some consistency at City Hall. It would appear that the rules are different, and I’m not talking about how things are posted or how things are presented, I’m talking about the same level of scrutiny that each Councillor, who has Councillor’s ward allowance goes through in terms of the way the audit looks, or the auditor looks at those financial transactions. So I…that's all I have to say as an opening. I’ll have more to say at the closing.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Deputy Speaker: </SPAN>So her speakers, any speakers…Councillor Nordman to start.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Nordman: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It’s my pleasure to rise today and I’m going to ask that we refer this motion back to governance which eventually would make it to EPC, but I just feel that we have made a discussion of this in the month of May. It was at the table of the Governance Committee in June and it's really already under discussion. So I’ll leave it at that and ask for the referral. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Deputy Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck, three minutes.</P>
<P class="p79 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Point of order. Is that a motion of referral or just saying you’d like it referred? So then now are we not dealing with a motion of referral on this item. Okay, thank you.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Deputy Speaker: </SPAN>We’ll be voting on the motion, first. Yeah, first we get Councillor Havixbeck rebut.</P>
<P class="p38 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Okay, thank you for that opportunity, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I guess, in rebuttal to that, and having it heard here and now we could decide once in for whether it wouldn’t forward. I think that we are in an era where citizens expect transparency. They want openness and I think that when you live in one area of the city for example, you live in a certain school division. You pay a certain school division’s tax rate, you don't pay a different tax rate and so I think for the essence of having consistency, we need to move this along and I have requested that the 2013, that that be undertaken. So, I think there is some urgency because the Auditor would need to decide on his priorities and how that would be affected. There needs to be a definitive policy, things like travel, conferences. If these are discretionally why does the committee, why does the entire committee, for example, not travel and not use that? Why are the balances not published and decided on at the committee level?</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>(Inaudible)…talking about the motion refer here or debating the actual motion?</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Deputy Speaker: </SPAN>She’s rebutting on the motion and that’s it.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>I don't think this is on the motion to refer.</P>
<P class="p60 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I’m trying to impress upon Councillors the urgency of having this dealt with now rather than referring to the next governance meeting and having it come back through the channels, it will be December or January.</P>
<P class="p18 ft1">Mr. Deputy Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Continue.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p60 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Just, further to what I was saying, having these balances published; having them reported to each standing policy committee; having them decided on at each of those committees, I think those are essential things that the public wants to see, and this is not peculiar to Winnipeg. Every city across Canada is considering and contemplating changes to these, even as high as the Senate in Canada. There’s heightened scrutiny of the way we spend money and I think it's imperative that we move on this sooner. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Deputy Speaker: </SPAN>So are we going to have a recorded vote? (Inaudible) and deal with number…(inaudible) All those in favour? Please stand...to a referral, please stand.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p49 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Speaker Nordman. My question today, and we’ve been discussing the quality of our City of Winnipeg water, and there’s currently what I think is a <NOBR>Federal-Provincial</NOBR> and Municipal issue in that Trans Canada Pipeline is creating…is going to be applying quite soon, shortly, for what they call the “Energy East” or Bitumen Pipeline, and I have some concerns in that the City of Winnipeg apparently is not being considered to be a stakeholder and the proposed pipeline is going to be going very close to Shoal Lake or very close to that neighbourhood where the City of Winnipeg has its main intake for water, and what I’m concerned about is that the Trans Canada Pipeline people have not saw fit to consult anybody in Winnipeg in terms of the general population, and I’m just wondering, the question to the Mayor first of all is that is he aware of any consultations with the City in terms of changing what is basically a gas pipeline to a Bitumen…basically crude oil or whatever pipeline which can really stink, doesn’t evaporate into the air. Have we been consulted?</P>
<P class="p50 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I thank Councillor Eadie for the question. We have not been, to the best of my knowledge, consulted on that issue but that does not mean, Mr. Speaker that we cannot be active in the scenario by also sharing our thoughts with those who are participating. There are levels of government who are a part of this process and I certainly would be happy to communicate our concerns if we’re not able to be present and let them know that we obviously are concerned about the safety of our water, so that’s something I’d be happy to follow up on and I thank the Councillor for that.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p60 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes. Trans Canada Pipeline will be applying in late 2013, early 2014, to the National Energy Board and it’s, as I understand it nowadays, when a new pipeline is built such as this one which will be…the new part is from Alberta to Manitoba, that a pipeline operation will have to have a billion dollars in assets, or a billion dollars in cash to be able to deal with any disasters that may happen and I’m wondering if the Mayor could, in providing a consultation to or supplying our concerns as a stakeholder to that process as to whether or not what the particular damages could be with the worst case disaster at Shoal Lake, what effect that would have on our system here in Winnipeg.</P>
<P class="p89 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I would be more than happy to also address that issue and have our administration or yours truly communicate with the other levels of government to make sure that those are addressed and try and look into any potential, you know, circumstances of disaster I think is what the Councillor is referring to, so I will find out as much as I can. I’ll be happy to consult with the Councillor and if Council, once we have the information, would like a Council seminar, I’d be happy to do that as well Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p90 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, and maybe just to circumvent before it happens, the Trans Canada Pipeline decided not to do it, that somehow our City get in contact with the National Energy Board, that we are concerned that we haven’t been consulted as a stakeholder in this particular project.</P>
<P class="p18 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I think that’s what I was referring to as communicating with them, so I can assure you that will be done Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p58 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker, through you to the Mayor. I have a question about the Police Board, and I’m asking the Mayor because I realize there’s a Chair of the Police Board, but I am purposefully asking the Mayor because this Police Board is something that all of Council is accountable for. At the September 6 meeting, I noticed that a motion was walked on asking for a report on cameras for police officers, and asking for a report back to the Police Board, and then I heard in the media that the Chair was supportive of this idea, loves the idea, and I guess what I’m…the question I’m trying to get at here is I’m concerned about how ideas come forward and flow to the Police Board agenda, because the whole idea of the Police Board, as I understood it, was that it was supposed to be apolitical. It was supposed to be, you know, an objective expertise that ideas come forward for best practices and such, and you know, and then in the media you hear the Police Chief speaking against it. It’s becoming this political thing and I guess my question is, can the Mayor provide assurance that the Police Board will be operating in that kind of objective manner and that recommendations will be based on the objective best practice and not on individual appointees to the Board’s</P>

<P class="p91 ft2">viewpoint, and I would like…I can ask in Councillor Fielding’s question period as well, although there isn’t a question period for the Police Board actually, so I’m asking the Mayor. As the Mayor, is he concerned about this?</P>
<P class="p33 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I thank Councillor Gerbasi and I think that’s a fair and reasonable question as well, so I think we all want to believe and do believe that all members of any board, including of course the Police Board, would act fair and objectively and in the best interests of the citizens of Winnipeg. I also very strongly would urge the Councillor during Protection and Community Services, to ask Councillor Fielding who is the Chair and hear from him since he is the Chair and I’m not, but from my opinion yes. All Board members should be acting fair, objectively, in the best interests of the citizens of Winnipeg.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p93 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>In <NOBR>follow-up,</NOBR> I’m not suggesting anything was unfair. It’s really more of a governance issue in terms of how do things get on an agenda and I guess, I think there’s a concern, because all Councillors have different ideas. We’ve heard many of Councillor Fielding’s ideas as the Chair, you know. Certain ideas he’s put forward about policing. I mean, are we just going to start seeing those on that agenda or…how do those ideas and what is on that agenda come forward? Does it come from community meetings? Does it come from the Executive Director who’s hired and the Police Department, or does it come from individual members who have political ideas they want to bring forward to that Board? Like, is it any different than a Standing Committee or does it function differently because it’s a Police Board. That’s what I’m trying to get at.</P>
<P class="p48 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p58 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I believe that good ideas come from everywhere and anywhere to be very frank with you. Also, I believe that Councillor Gerbasi is aware that this was created by the Provincial Government. They have basically set the guidelines. We have created the <NOBR>by-laws</NOBR> and maybe spending some time going through that, but I do believe that a lot of these questions could more than likely be answered by the Chair of Protection and Community Services, so once again I urge the Councillor to ask those questions and I’m sure the Chair would be happy to answer them.</P>
<P class="p90 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question?</P>
<P class="p93 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you very much. My last question is on the different matter. As you know the Federal Government recently made participation in the long form census optional and we learned this week that a number of Winnipeg neighbourhoods are now no longer basically…we don’t have data about them in the census which is very important data on a broad range of things which helps governments, private sector and <NOBR>non-profit</NOBR> organizations determine the needs of the community. Through you to the Mayor, are you concerned about this? Do you have any intention of discussing this with the Federal Government and how are we going to deal with the fact that a number of our neighbourhoods are basically invisible in terms of census data, going forward with this new approach to not requiring the long form census?</P>
<P class="p48 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I believe each and everyone one of us is of the opinion that everyone should be part of the census. That’s number one. The other side of the coin Mr. Speaker, I’ve seen so many people make reference to a census today that took place years ago and is no longer valid, so there’s pros and cons of the census material, how valid it is and how current it is. By the same token, I very much believe that everyone should participate in a census, absolutely.</P>
<P class="p90 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>To the Mayor through you, last week we had a Council seminar held on Monday, September 16, and at that seminar I asked where the Fire Chief was, and I was told he was on vacation. Will the Mayor tell us, is the Fire Chief in fact on vacation?</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Personnel matters are not discussed here on this floor of Council alright? So I’ll rule that question out of order.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>So is that counting towards my three questions?</P>

<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Okay thank you. (inaudible speaking in the background). I’m not sure he wants it but…alright. Further to my point about the Council seminar, we were briefed on a motion that was supposed to be here at Council today that involved the Province and how infrastructure priorities were going to be handled this fall. Can the Mayor tell us why is this item not on today’s agenda?</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, could you please ask the Councillor to be specific and make reference to exactly what it is she is referring to? I would appreciate that very much.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Alright. You heard the Mayor’s request.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>We were presented with a <NOBR>two-page</NOBR> item that explained how the priorities would be negotiated with the Province. Concerns were raised and discussions occurred at that session and it’s not here today. My understanding was we’re having a Council seminar, it’s imminent.</P>
<P class="p94 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi’s looking at me in bewilderment Mr. Speaker. I’m not sure exactly…I think she is referring to infrastructure projects, or are you referring to (inaudible). Could you please identify what it is you’re asking?</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>At that seminar…my recollection of that seminar is that it in fact that was adjourned.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>No. A number of items were on the agenda that day. It was a <NOBR>two-hour</NOBR> meeting. The first hour and 45 minutes were spent on the fire issue and dealing with numbers of staff, staffing issues. The last 15…one item was adjourned to another Council seminar but the last 15 minutes, and perhaps the Mayor wasn’t there and maybe the Deputy Mayor could answer this question because this was discussed and it’s not here today.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I now understand the confusion. As the Councillor knows, I was there for the first half. I wasn’t there for the second half. So unfortunately, I’m really not sure what she’s referring to, but as the Councillor knows, she can come up and discuss it with me any time and ask me and I’d be happy to look into it once I found out what it is she is referring to.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Can the Mayor tell us when the Fire Hall audit will be released and what the process for that will be.</P>
<P class="p18 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I cannot tell you that because as the Councillor knows, the Auditor is in charge of that. I do know that all members of Council, including yours truly, did get a letter the other day saying it would not be coming this week. It would be coming later on. So I can assume they are referring to sometime in October but that’s just an assumption. I have no more information than the Councillor has.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>And this is my mulligan right? While I was Chair of Protection and Community Services Committee, I pushed very hard for a library strategy.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">(inaudible speaking in the background)</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">What’s that?</P>
<P class="p29 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Carry on.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I believe we’re allowed a <NOBR>pre-amble.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p38 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker I actually received a call on this, or I should say a text and I did communicate with the Councillor who, unfortunately, it appears is very unhappy with the direction the Department and the Administration is going in and expressed her concerns to me and basically wanted me to intervene in the process. Unfortunately Mr. Speaker, I hope all members of Council appreciate, I don’t intervene in the process of the Department doing their job. There is a process, they’ve gone through it, they’ve made a recommendation. I know the Councillor is not happy with it. It’ll go through the normal process. They’ve done their due diligence. They actually sent me a letter late last night, how many times they’ve tried communicating with the Councillor but were unable to, and they’ve landed on what they believe is best for the City. In the end, through the process, Committees will deal with it. It’ll come to Council eventually and a decision will be made.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Mayor. Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker. Mr. Mayor, I want to ask you a few questions.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>You have to do it through me.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>I said through you.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Okay. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Mr. Mayor. I want to ask you a few questions about our new stadium. What is the total cost?</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, to the best of my knowledge, the cost that I know is the same cost that we’ve all seen. It was a GMP of approximately $200 million is the cost. I can also tell you that the City’s participation was $7.5 million and we also spent $2.5 million in investment in a facility at the University of Manitoba. In case the Councillor isn’t aware of it, both the City and the Province…the Province is playing the bank. They put up the majority of the money. They will be paid back over a period of time from the property taxes once the old site is developed, because in the past we were getting zero dollars from it.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Why are Phil Sheegl, the President of BB Stadium Incorporated, the organization responsible for building the stadium, the Winnipeg Football Club and the Provincial Government, silent about all the expenditures over the original cost that the public was told about? The public would like to know.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, for clarification, BBB consists of representatives from the City, from the Province and the Winnipeg Football Club. That’s number one. Number two is that I think it’s already been stated that they had some expenditures and they’re looking to address it. It’s already been stated by me that, let them work it out because the City basically has put in what we were asked. We’ve fulfilled our commitments and I can assure you that the Province and the football club will resolve the issues because they don’t have any choice but to find a solution. So they will find a solution.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Mr. Mayor you may have answered that. My third question. And who is paying for the over- expenditures. You’re saying the City’s not paying a cent.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I’ve made it very clear to everyone who will listen, that the City has put in its share. We’ve fulfilled our commitments, which is the way I think it should be. They have a wonderful, new <NOBR>state-of-the-art</NOBR> facility; one of the best in the country. If there are things that were overlooked or had to be done, you know, between the other people that are involved in that process, they will find a solution. By the same token Mr. Speaker, I am one member of this Council. That is my opinion. If Councillor Smith and others feel we should spend more money, that’s their prerogative. I’ve already stated what I feel.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>I have nobody else on the list for question period. Councillor Eadie.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p63 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Speaker Nordman, I’d just like to ask the proper question. Recently we became aware of a new Manitoba/Winnipeg Infrastructure Agreement and that wasn’t on today’s agenda and I’m just wondering why not and do we actually vote on that particular agreement before it’s signed.</P>
<P class="p28 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p43 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, that’s an agreement between the Province, the City of Winnipeg, MWIE. The realities are there have been changes. We’ve actually discussed this on the floor of Council earlier this year. In the past, the Provincial Government would provide approximately $35 million over a <NOBR>six-year</NOBR> period of time. It would go into infrastructure projects. The City would look at its priorities and make those decisions and everything was fine. Just recently, about six months ago, the Province basically said we’re not doing that anymore. From now on, we both have to agree. They want input to decide where this money is going which caused us a great deal of stress, shall we say, because some of those monies were already allocated to projects and I hope members of Council remember saying now it’s our responsibility to <NOBR>back-fill</NOBR> these projects. As a matter of fact, it was discussed here at length and nothing has changed. I can tell you that I have asked our Administration to go back to the Provincial Government because, number one, in the <NOBR>six-year</NOBR> commitment, there’s no inflation. We all know what something is worth building today, how it changes in six years. There’s no inflation. If there is no inflation, why are we signing a <NOBR>six-year</NOBR> agreement, maybe three would be plenty and then we can try renew and get more the next <NOBR>go-around,</NOBR> and also to confirm that the City and the Province have to jointly agree to move forward with any project, which I believe that has been answered. The other two I’m waiting for. I hope that addresses Councillor Eadie’s questions and, as I say, this is done from Administration to Administration, but I believe it’s up to yours truly and all members of Council to protect the interests of the citizens of Winnipeg.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>So Speaker Nordman. I think what the Mayor is saying is that it was sent back to Administration to negotiate a few more points before it comes to Council?</P>
<P class="p33 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I believe that could be a very accurate statement Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Okay. Any further questions for the Mayor? We’re leaving 10 minutes on the table here. Councilor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Can’t leave 10 minutes on the table. At our last Council seminar, an item that I had brought forward last January for a Council seminar, was deferred from that agenda. Can the Mayor tell us when that item will be heard, and to refresh his memory, it was a report, a verbal report from the Administration about municipal buildings, the levels of risk associated with whether there was a fire. To what degree the City’s buildings and administration properties were insured. So the question is, when will that be held?</P>
<P class="p90 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I very much remember that because I know the Councillor has had several dialogues with the Chief Financial Officer. I’d be happy to talk to him since that’s his territory, or maybe she can contact him directly because I know they do have an ongoing dialogue and if she can’t get the answer then I’m happy to as well, but I know they have been discussing it.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p58 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I’ve gathered some data over the last week for Calgary. 14,609 full time equivalents, 55% of employee costs. Edmonton 11,718 employees, 59% total cost. I’ve got about six other major cities. Can the Mayor tell us…I’m sure the Mayor can tell us how many people work for the Goldeyes on a full time basis, but can the Mayor tell us how many actual employees work for the City of Winnipeg and what percentage of our budget that is, approximately.</P>
<P class="p25 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p60 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I think it’s rather clear to most people that with the emergency service and all our other employees, that our number one cost is labour. That’s number one. Number two, I know that the Councillor has asked the Administration for this, and the realities are it’s easy…they can answer the question and give a number but keep something in mind Mr. Speaker. You can give a number this morning and that number could change this afternoon. So</P>

Send me an email, send me a text. I’ll be happy to get all the details that she would like.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p29 ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: <SPAN class="ft2">That’s fine thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Through you to the Mayor, I just want to make sure, or ask the Mayor if he’s aware that the number of full time equivalents budgeted each year is included in our <NOBR>service-based</NOBR> budgeting approach for the operating budget.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Yes Mr. Speaker, I am. But I know that has not been a sufficient answer in the past for the Councillor so obviously she is looking for more which is why I am saying that maybe if you put it in writing we’ll be able to, but yes I am thank you.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Just to make sure the Mayor and maybe all Councillors are aware that our metric is full time equivalents, not number of employees. Could the Mayor just verify that?</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>First of all I should thank the Councillor for giving the answer this way, but yes. We look at FTEs which is full time equivalents Mr. Speaker. That’s the way we do it.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Seeing no further questions we’ll move on to other standing committee reports.</P>
<P class="p95 ft1">STANDING POLICY COMMITTEE ON FINANCE</P>
<P class="p96 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>We have nothing from Finance today. No report, no motions, no consideration of <NOBR>by-laws.</NOBR> Do we have any questions for the Chairman of Finance? Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Through you Mr. Speaker to the Chairman and Deputy Mayor, can…this has been a discussion item at the Committee level. Can the Chair clarify for us the number of full time equivalents and the background about, perhaps maybe why this number is not readily available?</P>
<P class="p94 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker, and Councillor. I was expecting this question potentially, so…the total full time equivalent, which is, as Councillor Swandel correctly pointed out how we calculate…F.T.E.’s…for the City of Winnipeg which is the 2013 adopted budget - 8,770.5. So eight seven seven zero point five. That is the total. That includes the <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> Tax Supported Budget term which I don’t like, because the utilities are tax supported but we call it the Tax Supported Budget. Total amount Mr. Speaker is 5,976.49. The utility operations, which includes Utility, Municipal Accommodations, Transit, Water and Waste utilities which is sewer disposal, solid waste disposal, waterworks, and then our SOAs which, as we know from previous debates, are somewhat tax supported but we’ve put them in a category as <NOBR>non-tax</NOBR> supported, brings the total Mr. Speaker to the 8,770.5, so this is the difference. So, you know, I want to qualify this by saying there was a motion Mr. Speaker at EPC in July. There has been a practice in the past in the City with regards to capital projects where a capital project is budgeted and specifically Water and Waste has given us the assurance that this is no longer a practice within their utility, but it’s still a matter of concern inside Public Works where they will hire folks in terms of implementing the capital project, and this is the concern that we have and it’s come to the forefront over the last year in terms of the budget working group’s work and it’s what the work...and I think it’s what the CFO tried to address on that Friday Finance Committee, that there is going to be a clear statement in terms of that so that we know exactly, so I’m qualifying it in terms of that Mr. Speaker to say that the numbers that I’ve given could change because of the fact that we have that matter to deal with inside Public Works specifically is more the concern. So we do know…I don’t have the answer in terms of the percentage of payroll right now at the tip of my fingertips but I’m sure we can get that percentage of payroll to the overall budget but the reality is Mr. Speaker, I’m glad that Councillor raised the other cities because you can see the difference in terms of the overall staffing. When Calgary…I think the number you used was 14,000 and change or something…I can’t remember the number. They’re a</P>

<P class="p57 ft4">city of just over a million people. We’re a city of 700,000. You know, actually when you compare the two, you know, Winnipeg…we know. We know we as a City right now deliver our municipal services on a per capita basis which is basically by every citizen on some of the lowest costs in Canada right now. Unfortunately, I think it does reflect, Mr. Speaker, in terms of the programs we can offer and not offer and in terms of the challenges we face with our infrastructure. Even Edmonton, which is a smaller city than Calgary at 11,718. I was able to write that one down in time…is, you know, quite a bit higher than the City of Winnipeg, so you know we’re aware and we know that FTEs are definitely a driver in terms of the overall budget and it’s a concern with regards to ensuring that we have to deliver a balanced budget that we keep those costs at bay.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Further to that, the number presented, I believe, was budgeted. Can the Chair assure me that the budgeted equals the actual, because this 2013 budget was premised on hiring 320 more people? Can the Chair assure me that the 8,770.5 is what the actual FTE number is today or for (inaudible)?</P>
<P class="p38 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Well, and that’s the issue. The issue is why we moved the motion back in July at EPC is the issue of…and she said it quite well…actual versus budgeted. And that’s the issue. The concern that the past practice over the many years has been in terms of the capital projects where the actual is different than the budgeted, so it’s a concern but the good thing is it’s being addressed and I’m hoping that we’re targeting, as you’re aware Mr. Speaker, we’re targeting the budget to come forward for consideration and hopefully be dealt with before Christmas and the motion in terms of the FTEs specifically said January. The report will be ready then, but I’m hoping we can somehow ensure that we can get those numbers forwarded sooner so…</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p45 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes thank you Mr. Speaker. At our last Finance Committee meeting, we learned of a surplus of $7.2 million, and I believe the breakdown that was provided by the Department was 4.2 million from local streets coming in under budget and 3 million from regional streets, and yesterday a press release went out about additional work that is to be done. The question I have for the Chair is, given that 4.2 million, and the Chair of Finance was very specific in this year’s budget when he brought forward the one percent property tax increase…that the money needed to go directly to local streets and local improvements, and according to this list, and while I’m supportive of any new work because it is imperative and we’re constantly hearing with, and facing the challenges of needing further infrastructure money…the question is, has the 4.2 million followed the one percent property tax motion and been tied to local streets, and this is the Finance portion of the question. I realize that it is Public Works related and I will be asking the Chair of that Committee as well.</P>
<P class="p58 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Speaking to the question, this was announced yesterday in terms of…and first of all Mr. Speaker, you’re a member of the Committee as well. You know, it’s not…I’m acting as the Chair, but this is Council’s budget. We as EPC work together to bring forward the budget. That is the mandate under the Charter. It’s not a Ministerial system right? Secondly the other part of this Mr. Speaker is I want to first of all thank the Councillor. I asked the question who moved the motion at Finance. How was this before us? She had referred it. I think it was from Council in terms of the status of the funding on streets, both regional and local. We heard from Mr. Lester Deane of Public Works and we heard that because…and this is a good news story, because of the fact that there was competitive pricing from the private sector. The pricing came in approximately $7.2 million under budget. He did qualify that by saying that they got to ensure that the funding in terms of warranty work and all the projects, that number can actually change. It can actually go down or potentially up. So we heard from Mr. Deane and the fact that Public Works Department was aware. I think there was the fact that we have the August break. They were aware at the end of July. They’re reluctant, I suppose, to starting issuing work without consulting with members of Council, but you know it was upon hearing the information I think was then the motivation over the last week for the Public Service to identify projects as soon as possible and to bring them forward to get the funding earmarked. They brought forward the list. They came forward and said this is what we’re ready to do now. There was no consultation in terms of with me or I’m not sure with other members of E.P.C., but definitely I know the fact that they just said, here it is and we can get going on this right away. And that’s great and I want to thank the members of the Committee who spoke to this item, both yourself Mr. Speaker and Councillor Havixbeck, because this is funding that’s, you know, it needed work. Now, I hear what you’re saying in terms of the actual program versus what’s being spent but the reality is we need to get this work out. This is work that will ultimately have to be done one way or the other and it’s necessary. The Riverbank Stabilization work is an emergency Riverbank Stabilization work…$200…we don’t know what’s going to happen next year in terms of flooding in our City. You know, I’m going on the basis of trusting our staff who are the professionals to be able to say to us, look, this is something that we need to do right away. They’ve come forward with this and I’m happy to see that the funding for <NOBR>by-and-large…not</NOBR> all of it. As you know 3.15 million on Ness Avenue is slated for 2014. But the fact that <NOBR>by-and-</NOBR></P>

<P class="p97 ft2">large the majority of the funds have been earmarked to get work done as quickly as possible now is something that’s welcome. So I want to thank the members of the Committee for speaking to those items and the Public Service.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any other questions for the Chair? Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Speaker Nordman. I just wanted to clarify. It was a bit confusing in terms of the answer in the last question. The 2013 budget saw the one percent increase for the local street improvement fund which was to only be expended on the improvement of local streets. Now as I understand it the $7.2 million in savings due to lower bidding costs, lower material costs, was related to the whole regional local street program, not only just the local street renewal reserve, and so do we know exactly how much of that $7.2 million was savings for the actual reserve that we have established for just local street renewal?</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>There was a breakdown given in the Committee. I can get that for Councillor Eadie in terms of…the overall budget went from approximately 30 million in terms of regional local streets to about 62 million. So it more than doubled actually in terms of spending, so now of that, a percentage of it, was the local street renewal reserve which, as you are aware, was the amount of the $4 million, let’s say, and then the borrowed 10 million, which is $14 million, of that total 62. So the reality is when you set that aside, okay, the 7.2 million which was a combination of regional streets and local streets, what percentage in terms of…or was related to local street renewal reserve. The Administration I’m sure would say to us if we asked the question…well no this is tied to the previous funding that we had, so the reserve is still intact. Council policy is still there, and is being followed, but the reality is they wanted…we wanted to make sure based on what we heard in the Standing Committee of Finance to get funding out there as quickly as possible. And an aspect of this does include an enhancement of the TBO program, so I hope that answers your question Councillor.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question or not?</P>
<P class="p60 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yeah just basically maybe you could tell me if that report just said…I noticed in the list of projects that there are some local street renewals and I’m not sure if that report actually detailed…if that was coming out of the reserve or not. Can you answer that or maybe I’ll just wait until you send me the report…or I’ll look the report up myself.</P>
<P class="p38 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Yeah, and you know of the announcement yesterday, which I received at the same time that you did, is the $1.2 million, the TBO Program which is funding to assist with rehabilitation of an additional 13 local streets, so of the 7.2, 1.2 million is geared towards that and $600,000 on top of that for the rehabilitation of local streets which includes Victor Lewis Drive, Sheppard Street, and Church Avenue…sorry including Victor Lewis Drive and Sheppard Street from Church Avenue to Redwood, so that’s Sheppard Street, so that’s $600,000 on top of the 1.2, so 1.8 million so in terms of local streets that was announced. The other 3.15 was the tendering in terms of Ness which, if it’s not a regional street off the top of my mind, it’s definitely a major collector, so that’s where it stands.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>I just wonder if the Chair of Finance could tell us how many of the budget line items or what percentage of the budget line items actually equal the actuals at the end of the year.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">(inaudible speaking in the background)</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Alright. I hear the answer to the question but I was…okay…yeah okay fair enough. I hear what the Councillor is saying so thanks.</P>

<P class="p63 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. At our last meeting in July, we voted on the establishment of the Exchange Waterfront Neighbourhood Development Plan. Specifically an item in there that has caused some controversy over the summer months was $10,000 incentive to potential purchasers for downtown condos in the Exchange. Subsequently, it was reported in the media that a Downtown Strategy Report, a report that did not come to Council, said that it would not have recommended to provide these incentives.

<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions? Seeing none. We’ll move to the Standing Policy Committee on Property and Development, report of September the 10<SPAN class="ft11">th</SPAN>. Councillor Browaty.</P>

<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It was pointed out by the area planner that…at the public hearing, there was discussion about changing two items which we agreed to, but didn’t get reflected in the report, specifically item no. 7. There was two items, where it references a two year period, that should be three year period. And Item No. 11, we’d also refer to one year period; it should be two year period. So I move that we adopt this as amended with the two amendments.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>All right. Any question or concerns? Okay, we’ll move it as an amendment.</P>

<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Item no. 7 should be again switched from two years to three years, two instances in that particular piece. And Item No. 11, which be switched from one year to two years, again that's consistent with what was done at community committee.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>I’m missing a page.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>This is item no. 5. Item no. 7. This is in the recommendation. 90 Lexington Park, not subsection 7, but recommendation no. 7 and recommendation no. 11. Can I table this for the…Speaker?</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie, go ahead.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>I think this is just more of a…point of privilege; I can't skim through a document such as this quite so quickly. I just want clarification, the one year to two years is that regarding rezoning agreements and what are…I don’t recall us usually giving three years for anything. Could somebody tell me what the three year period is for?</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor. Anybody else that want to speak at this point?</P>
<P class="p79 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>So Mr. Speaker, (inaudible) dealing with the Report of Standing Policy Committee on July 22, Item No. 7, Recommendation…what recommendation are we talking about?</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>My apologies. This is report No. 5.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councilor Swandel: </SPAN>Report No. 5, which is an extension…</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Recommendation No. 7. Yes…where are we here?</P>
<P class="p29 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Item 5.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p38 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>That in the event if the matter is not proceeded with expeditiously and the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> is not passed within, it says two years, it was agreed to at the hearing originally that this be three years due to the nature of the major redevelopment site, that Pallister is engaged in this being the first phase of that it be switched to three years. After adoption of the report by Council, that the matter shall be deemed to be concluded, which will not be processed with them unless an extension of time is applied for prior to expiry of the report. It’s two years, it’s going to be three year period. And Council approves the extension. And the other items, just scroll down slightly as item no. 11, that the planned subdivision shall be approved and signed by the Director of Planning and Property Development within, the report reads one year and that be switched to two years, again, just due to the nature of the larger major redevelopment site.</P>
<P class="p44 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">So…so…</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>(Inaudible)…has to do with Wellington Crescent? I’m looking at the report of the Planning Property and Development Committee dated…Oh, hang on, never mind. I’ve got it figured out now.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>It’s 90 Lexington. So, 7 goes from two to three years and 11 goes from one to two. Is that is? Okay. Councillor Steen.</P>
<P class="p18 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Are we dealing with seven, too?</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No, just, just, just…report 5, item 5. Subdivision rezoning 90 Lexington.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>That is my motion as amended.</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Question period for Property and Development. Councillor Mayes followed by Councillor Sharma.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. My question pertains to a new protocol that was developed a few months ago between the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and this protocol pertains to procedures about the placement of cell phone towers. As you know, right now the current protocol, the current rules that govern municipalities require no consultation with the public for any towers that are under 15 metres in height. The new protocol would require consultations for structures under 15 metres in height. This has been a very much alive issue in the southern part of St. Anne’s Road in my ward. A couple of different proposals that have created some controversy, so my first question is to the Chair, just where does the City of Winnipeg staff work, stand in terms of looking at or making recommendations on this new protocol for placement of cell phone towers?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>I thank you Mr. Speaker. I know our Department is certainly working with those organizations on that protocol. I don’t have an update to provide the Councillor at this time. I will be in contact with them for that information.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p60 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Just as a <NOBR>follow-up,</NOBR> and I know Councillor Gerbasi’s our representative at FCM and may have some input on this as well, but my second question is just where would…once we get some input back from the staff, and I know they were looking at this at least as far as August but we don’t have a report. Where would that…would that report feedback to Council or to your Committee. If we could just get that as part of the answer when that’s forthcoming.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>I can certainly request that a report be given at least verbally to the Committee at some point. I’m not sure if there was a request to get a formal report but I can look into that and get back to the Councillor.</P>

<P class="p46 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Okay. Councillor Sharma.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I understand there are further delays with the new restaurant opening in Kildonan Park. Can the Chair provide us an update? I’m getting many calls from residents and they’re very anxious to get into the new restaurant and use the space.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>I thank you Mr. Speaker. The response I received yesterday afternoon is as follows: “I have been advised that delays are associated with restaurant design issues such as kitchen exhaust, air conditioning and other related HVAC issues. A meeting with the architect, WOW Hospitality and the City, is planned for later this week. At that time we will have a better idea of when they will open.”</P>

Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p114 ft1">STANDING POLICY COMMITTEE ON PROTECTION AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</P>
<P class="p96 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Yeah, I raised the issue earlier about the Police Commission and I do recognize it’s a new structure among our Committees. It’s not really the same as another Standing Committee. It has unique governance under Provincial legislation and requirements, so I guess I just wanted to have some clarity about how issues come forward to be on the agenda there. So Councillors know…I mean…and there is a difference between the Chair of the Standing Committee speaking about an item they’re bringing forward there politically and up to Council, and there’s a difference how, where issues should come forward I think to a Police Commission which is not a political body in the same way I guess. I guess I’m just looking for clarification on that from the Chair.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p51 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Well thank you for the question. First of all, the Police Board follows all procedures, standard procedures that the City of Winnipeg does. The reality is, and I’ll get into the actual because you’ve brought the question about the policy item which I had talked about. But in terms of a process basis, what I did and what I normally do is before the meeting came forward, number one, this item is in our <NOBR>long-term</NOBR> agenda in 2016. So I called every member of the Police Board. As you know that there’s three members that are appointed by…citizen members. There’s two Councillors and there’s two Provincial appointees. So I called everyone before the meeting and said, this is an area of interest, a policy item that I’m very interested in and I’d like the Police Board to report back…or the Police Service to report back on the pros, the cons of the policy. So our procedure and policies allows you to do that in two different places. You can bring it up in new business which we did at the Board meeting. You can also suspend the rules and bring a motion forward similar to the way what you might be able to do at Executive Policy or whatever standing committees you’re on. So the policy simply asked for them to report back on it. Getting into the policy…first of all a good idea is a good idea is a good idea in my opinion, and every once in awhile, you know, Councillor Gerbasi has some great ideas, which, you know, I follow and want the Administration to take a look at. I’d like to think that every once in a while I’ve got a few good ideas as well. So, quite frankly, I asked the Police Service to report back. This is something that’s in their capital budget, so I’m assuming, unless it’s been in the capital budget and they’re not supportive of it. I question why they had a million dollars put in the budget in itself for (inaudible), so I was a little taken back to be quite honest with you of the Chief’s comments on it. We were asking for some feedback on it, so just to get</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p15 ft9">into the policy piece, if I could talk about the initiative. First of all I found out about the initiative…I’m on the Canadian Association of Police Boards being a part of this as well. This is an item that’s talked a lot about in those circles in terms of the Canadian Association of Police Boards and everything else. The <NOBR>body-worn</NOBR> camera, which I was talking about, is a small video recording system that’s worn either on your ear, or it can be worn on your lapel of your suit that’s there, and really what the camera has been very successful in other jurisdictions. The costs range anywhere from $900 to $1,200 per outfit that’s there, and the benefits are <NOBR>two-fold.</NOBR> Number one, you have instances where people are making false allegations against police officers. There’s one last summer for instance we knew about, and the real information came back, so having recording of the actual live coverage, or not live coverage but recording what incidents happen, it protects the police officers but it also protects the citizens. You always…incidents in the 90s and later on where there were some police interaction with people. It just allows you to have a second image. So is it a silver bullet? No but I think it’s an important tool. And of this, this isn’t something that’s, you know, an eye in the sky type of initiative. It provides quality evidence to use in prosecutions. It provides fewer <NOBR>use-of-force</NOBR> incidents. It decreases the suspect’s hostility and aggression for it, and it reduces complaints against police, protects allegations of misconduct as well and we’ve got a very positive response. A part of that, there’s a number of jurisdictions that are doing it since you brought it up. The jurisdictions are Calgary for instance that are doing a pilot project on this right now. Edmonton has a pilot project going on. Costs $500,000, not the million dollars that we have in our budget. Victoria also is involved in this and there’s a city, actually I read when I talked about this subject. I read on the New York Times website. There’s a city called…I’m going to say it wrong…Rialto, California, where they introduced a number of these body cameras on their officers. It’s a smaller jurisdiction, but what they actually showed was that 88 percent reduction compared to previous months against complaints versus officers and that same period of time, the use of force by officers were reduced by 60 percent over the same period of times. Now this is something that everyone supported in this Chamber through the Capital Budget, the outgoing years for it. I simply asked the Police to review this and look at it. It’s a best practice that’s being used. I’ve got the information, the data that’s there, so I think we’re going to have a full and open discussion for it, and quite frankly I had all the Board’s opinion to bring forward. Now if there’s some people that are here, and quite frankly I’ve been working with Councillor Eadie and a number of others and whether it be the Arson files and that sort which we’re having some meetings later on. If there’s some Councillors that have some ideas, they can pass it at the Protection Committee and refer it to the Police Board, or if you want to come out to make a presentation. Councillor Smith has said in the past he’s got some concerns - stabbing issues and that sort of stuff…come out and make your presentations. What I can commit to you is I’ll have the police review it, and sometimes it’s going to make sense and sometimes they’re going to agree and sometimes they’re not. But that’s the process and Councillor Steen is there and we’re liaisons to the Board. I mean obviously we know through the legislation that the Police Council does the global budget. The police implement…makes the policy changes. So that’s where policy items will be directed from now, but I’d also like to say that we’ve been very busy in summer. We’re ready on a kind of facility. We’re in the midst of hiring our Executive Director. We’ve had two Board meetings. We’ll be looking at all aspects of the force. We’ve been engaged every Tuesday this month in training sessions where we’ve had the Police Commission come in and do training sessions for us. They’ve brought in the Chair of the Calgary Police Board. They brought in yesterday, actually the Executive Director of the Edmonton Police Board. They also brought in the Executive Director of the Ontario Association of Police Boards to give us direction and also Mr. Rick Linden and Andrew Miner who is the Executive Director of the Police Commission have been a part of that. So we’ve been extremely busy with it. I’m extremely proud of the work and quite frankly I’m extremely proud of the way I generally try and deal with these things in an open basis. If there’s policies we’re going to look at them. I’m not going to say that they’re always going to support them, one way or the other. This my initiative, you’d think that the police will have a fair presentation. They’re going to report back on it. I’m know I’m sold on it already but let’s have that debate in public. Hope that answers your question.</P>
<P class="p115 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p79 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Through you Mr. Speaker to Councillor Fielding, why are we arresting and ticketing individuals who are taking a stroll on our park in the late evening and not causing a disturbance?</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Councillor Smith, I don’t have the particulars of the case you are referring to, but if you want to provide…could you clarify the question please?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>There was an item in the newspaper about this person who was arrested and ticketed and he’s now challenging in the courts. Anyway my second question…why this blanket policy against our citizens who want to take advantage of our limited green space.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>You know, I’m not quite sure the Police have jurisdiction over the parks. I do understand what you’re saying. I do question the point. Are you talking about after 10:30? Is that what you’re saying? Yeah…by the…I believe that’s the <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> that’s in place. Should probably referring the question to Public Works. They might have a better answer for you. For me, I don’t necessarily see a problem going through the parks at any hour. We’re hoping that they’re safe and secure. I know Assiniboine Park has some and I cycle quite a bit. I’m sure there are times when</P>

<P class="p41 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yeah, I gather that it’s not…it varies from park to park, and who decides the hours limiting the use of our parks?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>It’s certainly not the police in my opinion. I believe it’s probably a <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> through Public Works. Maybe Councillor Vandal might have some more comments and I could ask Administration how it came up with those protocols, but if you’re asking me do I agree with it? If that’s the case, you can’t go into parks after 10:30? No. I disagree with it. I think that as long as it’s safe and secure, you know, if you’re a regular person. If you choose to walk wherever you want then you can. I don’t personally see a problem with people going into our parks after 10:30.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie do you have your hand up?</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Speaker Nordman. I just…in hearing about the initiative that was proposed to the Police Board in terms of…and in the capital budget regarding police officers wearing cameras to protect both their integrity as well as the public, my question really is in the research that was done in regard to how this works at the various levels that he spoke of, the Canadian Police Board Association and so on, what are the difficulties around the general public actually getting what amounts to a record, a recorded video of an incident? What…are there some dynamics? Is it a protected record that requires FIPPA requests? How does that all work? That’s my question.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Sure, thank you Councillor.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>On a point of order, I’d suggest or move that we go till 12:30 rather than breaking for an hour and a half?</P>
<P class="p33 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p45 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>First of all thank you Councillor Eadie. Number one, first of all, there was actually a poll done on CTV TV. I probably forgot to mention this. That over 75 percent of our citizens, when it was asked in the poll, supported it. When I did do my research, actually a good friend of mine who I went to university with, Brian Bowman, he’s obviously the top privacy person or one of the top privacy people in the city. I specifically asked Brian, is there any issues with privacy, and he said absolutely not. It’s done in all these other Canadian jurisdictions. So the trick with privacy always, make sure you do the due diligence right? So you’ve got to do that due diligence beforehand, but in his opinion there’s absolutely no issues with the privacy. The way I’d see that happening….the Police got a million bucks built into their budget. Edmonton’s doing it for 500,000, so I’m not sure why they added a million dollars in their budget but apparently they do, but we’ll have to take a look at that as well. Edmonton is able to do it for 500,000, so I’m not sure where this $3 million number came from too which confounded me because all these other jurisdictions are doing it less. So there isn’t a privacy issue that’s there, and I’m just going to get on my horse as well here. You know I think where the police should be going with technology. I think that there’s a lot of great technology that’s out there right now. You look at what’s happening at VIA Rail station for instance. They’ve got facial recognition technology. If they’ve got a tip that someone is dropping off a bomb, you know, is wearing a red hat, they are able to run the facial tech…facial recognition technology that’s there. So I think that the police need to embrace some of this. I think that there’s a lot of expertise in the industry that can help us out with that. We always have to invest in capital technologies. So I think it’s incumbent upon ourselves whether it’s an idea like that or an idea versus the cameras that there’s no way in the world I’m going to stop, you know, bringing forth ideas. That’s my role as a Councillor I think, to bring forth new ideas. Some are going to be good, some are going to be bad, some are going to cost too much money or not. But, you know, I think that’s just the role of Council to do.</P>
<P class="p48 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Just a short…I don’t want to take up too much time, but I just…my question specifically is, if I was injured by a police officer unduly, can I just ask the Winnipeg Police Service to please send me the video tape so that I can use it for the purposes of proving my case? Is it that simple or not?</P>
<P class="p94 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>I don’t have all the information back on the privacy elements. We’ll have to engage some of the experts to see how you do that. My sense is if there’s some sort of Incident that’s in question, you know, I don’t see this as people live watching this as you go, but if there’s some sort of incident that happens you could pull up the recording. So I’m not sure with the privacy legislation, is that something you can get as a citizen, you know, or not, but we’re going</P>

<P class="p121 ft1">STANDING POLICY COMMITTEE ON INFRASTRUCTURE RENEWAL AND PUBLIC WORKS</P>
<P class="p22 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p27 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Through you to the Chair, I just want to ask a question about some of the additional projects that are being assigned for the extra money due to projects being under budget. And one of them is $2 million for immediate…and I’m reading right from the press release…”immediate emergency river stabilization work along the Red River to protect areas of Lyndale Drive”, and that also happens to be in the Councillor’s ward. Is the Chair aware that a contract was awarded on August 23, and I’m reading right from the City’s website, “for Lyndale Drive, for Monck Avenue to Tache for riverbank stabilization for the amount of 1.163350 to Borland Construction”, and if he is, is this new work; is this the work that is going to go on, and if so then this is really meaning that it’s $3.16 million worth of work that’s needed in the area?</P>
<P class="p80 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>I do know that Lyndale Drive has the riverbank has failed, Lyndale Drive. There is some pretty serious work that’s ongoing and has been for…since probably August. I don’t know of any new work, although I am assuming there’s going to be associated road works once the bank is stabilized and I’m also assuming, although I will get the details from the Administration, that this extra appropriation is financing of the work that’s being done as we speak.</P>
<P class="p90 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Just a further question to that, and I just want to clarify too that I am a huge proponent of our riverbanks. I think they are integral to our city and I think it’s a gem that’s really under…you know, if there was more money it would be ideal to be utilizing it in that area, and Lyndale Drive is of course a beautiful area, but I guess more specifically, how does the…a road program become a riverbank program, I guess is the question too and you know, if that requires the Chair to go back and get clarification that’s fine?</P>
<P class="p92 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>I will get clarification on that directly from the Department, but I can…if you’re familiar with Lyndale Drive, there’s Lyndale Drive, there’s a retention wall and then there’s the riverbank and the river, so when the riverbank fails it affects the road and I know there was a very serious hollow in the road which has to be filled and fixed, and they’re probably going to go, not just where the hole is but a reasonable amount of space on the west and on the east. But I will get a <NOBR>follow-up,</NOBR> some detail from the Administration.</P>
<P class="p90 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Through you Mr. Speaker to Councillor Vandal, Councillor Gerbasi and I put forward a motion at the July 17 City Council meeting to <NOBR>re-route</NOBR> the free Spirit bus to a grocery supermarket, giving downtown residents access to groceries at reasonable costs. How much time does Winnipeg Transit need to change the route? And I’m volunteering to help them if they need some expertise.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Well we did have only one meeting since the July meeting, since you introduced the motion in July. It was referred to the Administration. I think, I’m not sure on the timeline. It should be a short period of time. It should be at the next meeting, I hope.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions? Seeing none. That concludes the question period for Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works.</P>
