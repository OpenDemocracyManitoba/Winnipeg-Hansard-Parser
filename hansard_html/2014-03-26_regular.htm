<P class="p6 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. I’d like to recognize in the gallery Amy McGuinness, Team Lead and ten new 311 Customer Service Representatives who are observing today’s Council meeting. Thank you for joining us.

<P class="p8 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Nordman: </SPAN>Yes, I do, Madam Speaker. Thank you for recognizing me. It’s my pleasure to rise today and to recognize that, albeit he’s not a citizen of the City of Winnipeg, but he is from the Capital Region, a gentleman by name of Dennis Thiessen who was on the gold medal wheelchair curling team at the recent Sochi Paralympics. He does curl at the Assiniboine Memorial Curling Club in Winnipeg, my club and we’re…I spoke with them last night and we’re so proud of what his accomplishment is and how he’s lived up to the challenge of his disability and brought home the gold for Canada. So congratulations, Dennis Thiessen.</P>

<P class="p11 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>We now have one delegation with us. Mr. David Sanders, he is appearing in support of Item No. 1, Citizen Reimbursement for Thawing of Frozen Water Lines. He is in opposition to five other items: Winnipeg Police Association Memorandum of Understanding…Memorandum of Agreement, pardon me. Second item, Full Time Equivalent Compliment. Third item, Service Agreement between the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation and The City of Winnipeg for the Winnipeg Police Service 2013 RoadWatch Program. Next item, Service Agreement between the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation and The City of Winnipeg for the Winnipeg Police Service 2013 School Zone Safety Enforcement Program. And also in opposition to the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation and The City of Winnipeg for the Winnipeg Police Service November 2013 Distracted Driving Enforcement Program. Mr. Sanders you have the floor.</P>
<P class="p12 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">David Sanders: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker, members of Council. My name is David Sanders and I’m appearing today as a private citizen to speak briefly in support of yesterday's EPC recommendation regarding frozen water lines and in opposition to certain specific recommendations on Council's agenda. With regard to the first matter, the citizen reimbursement for thawing of frozen water lines, I am not one of the 6,000 home and business property owners who are facing the serious difficulties and financial consequences of frozen water lines, but I am pleased to support the proposed exgratia payments to those affected. We all expect our city to be able to deliver portable water to our properties and I agree that it is good public policy to provide this type of cooperative community insurance against unforeseeable events. I don't think this is a natural disaster on the scale of a flood, tornado or epidemic. And I do think we taxpayers should be able to cover this problem with our municipal service without extraordinary disaster relief from the Federal and Provincial governments. However, this resolution is not the whole solution. There appeared to have been a variety of promises</P>

<P class="p16 ft6">made to adjust the water bills of the good neighbours who have allowed people to connect to their water systems temporarily and to adjust the water bills of people advised to run cold water continuously to avoid freezing. The press reports today, that have seemed somewhat unclear, but I am glad to see that the frequently asked questions about frozen water pipes which now appears on the City's web site does address each of these matters and fairly specifically. It also appears though that the freezing of water lines is not unique and no longer unforeseeable. And I ask, what are we do about it? Given the cost and aggravation now faced by the affected citizens and the City as a whole, we do need options and a plan for addressing this problem more effectively in the future. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to all of the Civic employees from a variety of departments who have pitched in to help the residents and businesses affected and I can't resist saying I imagine it was a good thing that they were all working regular shifts between Christmas and New Year’s Day last year. While I’m at…I also like to support the recommendations in your agenda Item 2 regarding the Restoration and Preservation of Aquatics Hall of Fame and Museum of Canada. The founder, Vaughan Baird, was a very good friend of my family and he died unfortunately eight months ago. And I believe he will rest easier now knowing that this tribute to Canadian diving and aquatic sports excellence will remain in good hands. With regards to the second matter, the Winnipeg Police Association Memorandum of Agreement, for six months I’ve been asking why the City of Winnipeg has failed to finalize the text of the WPA Collective Bargaining Agreement covering the previous period, 2010 to 2012 and to post on the Corporate Support Services public web page. That agreement has still not been published. Now, I guess it's 16 months after it expired. And I still ask why not? Nevertheless, I should like to congratulate the negotiating committees of the City and the Winnipeg Police Association for reaching agreement on a memorandum of agreement for the new collective bargaining agreement for December 24, 2012 to December 23, 2016. I presume the words as well as the numbers are important and therefore I believe the complete text of the memorandum which is dated February 13th, 2014, should have been appended to this report if EPC and now City Council are actually being asked to approve it. All we have here is a summary document prepared by the Civic administration. We don't even have the Civic administration's report on negotiations between the City of Winnipeg and the Winnipeg Police Association dated February 28th which has supposedly been reviewed by the City's internal and external auditors. Now, I do have reason to believe there has been some consultation with the Winnipeg Police Board, but if that is the case then I think that the consultation section of this morning's report should have acknowledged that. In any event, I wish to express my opinion that the particular recommendations before you fail to meet the legal requirements for Council approval. Both the City of Winnipeg Charter Act requires that Council not delegate the authority to enter into collective agreement and the City's own bylaw for City organization makes the same requirement. Council must approve the agreement and the agreement is not in front of you. In the final draft of the WPA Collective Agreement, including the terms of the 15 settlements and agreements as finally prepared, I suggest that it should all be submitted to City Council for ratification as required by law. And then it should be posted on the City’s Collective Bargaining Agreement web page immediately. When I spoke to this matter at EPC, I did not receive an understandable explanation as to how…and stated in the report, existing budget amounts are sufficient to cover the $64 million in additional costs for the four year term in the new agreement. Well, at the same time, the City’s 2015 and 2016 projections presented to Council in December and I quote "contain significant shortfalls and require modification to balance." Since it appears that many of the other new collective bargaining agreements, settled and yet to come, will also require significant modifications to the 2015 and 2016 operating budget projections. I believe Council should now request a comprehensive update on the budget projections no later than the June Council meeting well before the Civic election this fall so we won't have more unrealistic promises of tax freezes. I do note that in December before these agreements, the City was already projecting property tax shortfalls of $79 million in 2015 and 109 million in 2016. And again, unless there be any misunderstanding, for the record I am in favour of paying our Civic employees well and hiring enough of them to provide the multitude of services which are required by this community and that certainly applies to the Winnipeg Police Service. With regard to the full time equivalent complement report, that report represents a major step forward in the presentation of relevant information for the effective management of the City’s most important resources, its employees. However, that 2013 statement does not go…it counts of the effects of vacancy management whatever that is, last year, the report does not address the projected effects of Council's 2014 operating budget decisions which require salary cost reductions of 14.1 million for whatever vacancy management is. And 1.5 million for 3.5 unpaid days of mandatory leave next December for many civic employees, nor the reduction in WAPSO positions ordered. At EPC, I said I assumed that vacancy management is a euphemism for a hiring freeze, which means that whenever a position is vacated for any reason, such as retirement, resignation or just cause, it cannot be filled except with the special approval of some senior Civic administrator or Council or committee who would be charged with ensuring that the 14.1 million in salary savings is in fact achieved by delaying the hiring of replacements during the year. At EPC, the Interim Acting Chief Administrative Officer denied that the City has a hiring freeze. Well, I don't want to argue about words but the term vacancy management implies an effort to manage or to restrain the filling of vacancies and I continue to believe that that is how Council intends to achieve the proposed budget reductions. It's not an uncommon budget policy unfortunately, but it may have severe consequences for the effective management of staff and the maintenance of adequate staff levels to handle important services. So I strongly suggest and continue to do so, that EPC should review and approve some meaningful guidelines and priorities for the use of vacancy management strategy in 2014 so as to minimize the negative effects. And as for the unpaid mandatory leave being forced on Civic employees as an end of year bonus for difficult jobs well done. I believe that EPC should now identify who the lucky employees will</P>

<P class="p19 ft4">be and what the consequences will be for service levels. When Council and the public have that information, you might be persuaded to look for the 1.5 million somewhere else. And finally with regard to the various service agreements which Council is asked to approve today, there is no mention of prior consultation in these matters with the new Winnipeg Police Board and they all contain a recommendation, at least the three I referred to, that the Winnipeg Police Board be advised. And my opinion of recommendations such as these should’ve been presented to the Police Board first and then forwarded by the Board to the Standing Police Committee, EPC and Council for approval. And I also think that any filed text of anything that proposed agreements should be submitted to Council for formal approval as well. But finally, these reports all request retroactive approval for the 2013 programs. But the reports before you, first of all they talk about the programs being carried out in the future when in fact, it's the past and the reports fail to address why the Winnipeg Public Service failed to bring these service agreements forward for approval before now. And I wonder if this really means that the auditors, internal or external are doing their jobs and flagging these. I have some other matters that I wish to table with you which I am not permitted to do and therefore I hope that nevertheless, certain questions may be asked during the question periods today. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any questions for Mr. Sanders? Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. David, I just wanted to…you had been pretty critical of when you appeared at EPC and here again today of our vacancy management program which requires keeping vacant about 200 full time equivalent positions a year in order to get the savings of $14 million, so about 200 full time equivalents on a base of about 9,000 full time equivalent. I haven’t heard you criticize a different approach that’s been taken, the Province has decided to eliminate 600 positions over three years. I have in front of me, the Minister's speech from the budget of 2013. “Last fall, we committed to reduce the size of the civil service by 600 over three years and we are ahead of schedule on realizing that commitment”. So I haven't heard you at the NDP convention or anywhere else criticize the decision to permanently cut 600 positions on base, that would add 14,000, the Province is permanently cutting 600 out of 14,000. We're keeping vacant as they come vacant, the equivalent of 200 on the base of 9,000, so I want to give you the chance to indicate if you prefer us to permanently eliminate the positions or since you haven't…I haven’t heard you, maybe you’d like to use this opportunity to criticize the province for their decision to permanently eliminate 600 as you seem to be upset with us for keeping 200 open on a yearly basis.</P>
<P class="p22 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">David Sanders: </SPAN>Pardon me, I don't recall seeing you at one of the NDP conventions, but at any rate...okay. But, I think perhaps you are proving my point that the vacancy management means not replacing certain positions when it might otherwise be replaced, subject to approval based on the overall objective of reducing expenses. And it may or may not be appropriate depending on the particular position in question and all I was suggesting is that some guidance should be provided to the administration as to priorities and essential services and the like, rather than simply an unnamed approach. I think the City is suffering from a lot of lost positions over the last 10, 15 years which maybe were priority positions, but I don't know. I think that's something which EPC should express an opinion on.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Just to follow up then so you’re not saying that we should take the course of the Provincial government and permanently eliminate these positions. You’re saying the vacancy management may be preferable to that.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">David Sanders: </SPAN>No, I actually wouldn't say that. If a position is not required to provide service, then I think it would be appropriate to consider eliminating a position.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Any further question for Mr. Sanders. Okay, seeing none. You may return to the gallery. Thank you.</P>

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have spoken on this project previously in this chamber and wanted again to reiterate my support of the Seven Oaks Arena Project. The volunteers that back of this project are extremely dedicated and skilled individuals who have put countless hours into bringing it this far. Once completed, this project, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will be a true recreation hub, complete with a community centre, soccer complex, twin arena, fitness centre and an additional 3,000 square feet of programming space all incorporated under one roof. I want to thank the administration for their hard work in getting the project to this point and for the Mayor for his leadership and all of Council for their support to date. Once complete, this facility will be enjoyed by many families not only my constituents, but also from neighbouring wards and the city at large.

<P class="p41 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise of course in support of actually this report, but it came to my attention via <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> that people are concerned about business improvement zones in business areas. And I just wanted to say that this is a levy that's established, paid for by the businesses in the districts that are listed out and I think it's essential that they’re able to raise this money because what they do is they utilize this money to enhance the business environment within their areas. For example, in St. James, yes, we have many bad potholes in these areas, however, we do need to create conditions that bring people into business areas so that they feel comfortable and it's a good place to hang around and purchase the goods that a lot of these businesses have to offer. So this levy is one example of how business uses its own money to leverage more money to fix up and present really good business environments on the street and slowly but surely, the Selkirk Avenue Biz and the North End Biz which I’m closely related to, they are slowly achieving a better place to do business for customers and the business, small entrepreneurs that are there. And so there is an item further down the agenda that a number of…a citizen was quite concerned that the City would put up or match or leverage some money against the businesses’ money to make a particular area look good. So I just want to make it public that business does contribute as well to make sure that their places of doing business are the right thing. So this is a really good report. Each of those business improvements zones have looked at what are their needs to keep their business environments looking clean, trim and enhancing any assets along the streets to make it a better place. So I stand in support and thank EPC for moving this forward.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p36 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Yes, thank you. I’d like to thank Councillor Eadie for stepping this…standing this matter down for discussion. I too, have taken much pride in working with the Transcona Business Improvement Zone over the last number of years. I can tell you Madam Speaker, that the business improvement zone has had an extremely dedicated group of individuals in my community who worked tirelessly for the improvement of the business zone and their hard work and dedication has seen results over the last number of years when we started discussing different ideas in terms of how we should market the zone, how we should present the zone. About eight, ten years ago, it was, you know, we…one of the challenges and one of the issues cited by the board of directors was well we can market it, but what are we bringing them to? What are we showing them? What does the zone look like? In other words, how is it presented? And you know, and we definitely did have a challenge there. We had an older business district that really lacked some tlc. It had basically kind of…what in many ways, suffering, well, a lot of the old downtown districts, I call them the original downtowns of the old City of Winnipeg or <NOBR>pre-Unicity</NOBR> of the 13 original municipalities where they all…many of these searching original municipalities had their own downtowns and Transcona included, but just as our own downtown being downtown Winnipeg if you want to call it, has suffered from the redevelopment or development of large shopping malls and retail operations on the periphery or in the suburbs surrounding the city and outside of the downtown, so too, did the same competition and those developments have direct impacts on the older business districts of our original Unicity. And so there was a need to renew and to reinvigorate those areas and something that we’ve identified as the Transcona Business Improvement Zone. So a number of years ago, the City of Winnipeg funded a strategy for renewal of the area in terms of creating better public spaces and enhancing the public assets, being the boulevards, the sidewalks, and with the support of this Council Madam Speaker, we created a program combined with the Public Works Department in terms of their regional street and collector street renewal program, combined with sidewalk works. We as a City invested over $4 million over a period of time, doing street works, doing sidewalk works, doing the enhancements on the sidewalks, plus, included in that amount, Madam Speaker, was the creation in honour of the community's centennial, the Transcona Centennial Square, a quarter of an acre permanent City park located right in the heart of the community with a pavilion, with a stage, with a wall of fame there for citizens who have given to the community in the past, who have passed on, for their names to go on the wall of fame posthumously, and in the centre of it a peace fountain. We worked hard as a community to not only secure public funds, but also to raise money privately. And I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that significant amounts of money, well over half a million dollars to three quarters of a million was actually raised privately, much of it through naming rights. We sold the naming rights of the pavilion. We sold the naming rights of the wall of fame. We sold the naming rights of the peace fountain. We sold the naming rights actually of the clock tower, the clock tower itself to CN for half a million dollars. And we also then raised via a brick campaign over a hundred thousand dollars from residents. So actually, it was well over a million dollars raised privately. I correct myself when I started adding it up now. In terms of what was done. And it was absolutely amazing. The wall of fame is on the sides of the pavilion. You can actually see and you can go touch and see your name. There’s different levels, different “buy a brick” if you like, as well, that was available so residents were able to buy a brick at different levels of what they could afford for their families and for themselves and businesses were engaged as well. So it was a huge thing in terms of what can be done and I’ll tell you, Madam Speaker, and I want to thank again Councillor Eadie for standing this down because really none of this could’ve been done if it wasn’t for the fact that we had a business improvement zone that helped to spearhead and facilitate this process and really, you know, cause quite often, I think we…I don't know if we take it for granted or we often real…maybe underappreciate the great work they do and they do tremendous work and so you know the next step now is hopefully with this investment with regards to the public sector coming to the table and</P>

<P class="p43 ft4">citizens investing that we see also now private sector investment is starting to happen. We've seen private sector investment in terms of renewing the area, in terms of store front improvements, in terms of new businesses and that, Madam Speaker, is extremely exciting. So assessed values are actually increasing now in the downtown. For a number of years, the zone was actually…it’s tied as you know, the ARV…their levy, the biz levy is tied to right to the ARV, the rental values and I can tell you about six or seven years ago our rental values were dropping because of assessed values. We have turned that around now. We turned that around and we’ve actually seen that increasing and that was something that was crucial because you know if it was dropping and that creates a downward, negative cycle that is sometimes hard to get out of and it was crucial that we reversed that. It was crucial that we turned that around. We've also…I just want to make a note that right at the gates of Transcona, the CN shops have reinvested over $10 million in the last two years in the shops. You have more young people working in the shops under the age of 30 than you ever had before. More are people working under the age of 30 than people over the age of 30 right now at the shops. For the first time this…they’ve built female showers and female washrooms and showers because of the amount of females working in the shops and trades that were…before dominated by men. It's a huge change and the renewal of the shops and that impact on the community has been tremendous. So I’d like to thank the President Claude Mongeau of a CN, who has given so much support to the community in terms of that. So, again, thank you for allowing me to have this opportunity, Madam Speaker, to speak to this. The improvement zone is moving forward and there’s many other exciting things that we are working now, going into the future, building upon our successes. And I want to just make a point that we probably have the largest improvement zone. We were the first improvement zone or actually I think we were told one of the first places in North America to have wind turbines down the middle of a street to power lights. You have to go to China to see that. We did in downtown Transcona. We're the first…we’re the first zone or the first…probably the largest community in Winnipeg are now in terms of tree vaults. Trees in our streets die constantly. We made a decision to invest in tree vaults and these trees, believe it or not, the vaults do work. The trees are growing and they’re growing at an incredible rate and they’re healthy and strong and they’re in the pavement with vaults underneath the sidewalks holding nine square meters of <NOBR>un-compacted</NOBR> soil, allowing for the trees to grow. This is an asset that we’ll build in the future that will see down the road. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Yes, Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I apologize, I will have to be leaving the meeting early today to catch a flight. But I could not, not comment on the biz zone issue. As you know in Fort Rouge - East Fort Garry, we have five business improvement zones. So I spend a lot…a great deal of my time working with these as Councillors are on the board of all five of these zones and they do incredible work. I’ll be very brief, but without the voluntary contribution that these businesses, not voluntary, but they give additional tax revenue on top of their business tax to go towards the zone for streetscaping, cleanliness, programming in all these issues and you look at Corydon Avenue and what’s happened there. You look at the Downtown Biz get the Junos coming and the extra cleaning they do of sidewalks and snow clearing and beautification of public art and all those things, South Osborne, West Broadway is undergoing a street scaping project this year. So I just wanted to add my voice that we have 16 of these zones throughout the city and they do fantastic work. The mostly volunteers from small businesses and some of the zones that are quite small, they’re small business people that are volunteering their time. So I just wanted to thank them as well and thank you, Madam Speaker.</P>

<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>I saw your hand up.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Well, I just wanted to say that I’m very pleased that the Executive Policy had a bit of a change of a heart and has decided to go back and go back even further to December 1st when this issue first was raised at the Finance Committee on March 13 in the form of a motion we had said January 1st and that was based on information we had from the director of the department at the meeting. And so, I think it's very good, in fact, excellent and I’ve heard from constituents already on a <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> basis that they’re pleased that we are doing this and I think it's important that we drive this and that we are leaders with this because people are out of pocket. This was unexpected. Yes, it was an act of Mother Nature. It really wasn't something we could foresee to be as bad as it is, but I think rallying and rallying quickly and I also would commend the Mayor and EPC for gathering that information quickly, not waiting 30 days for a report so that people have to be out of pocket. I’m hopeful in my discussions with the director that those that were issued a bill for this kind of service in January can simply have a credit put onto their water bills so that this doesn't become onerous and cost prohibitive to move forward. So, that's all I want to say, is that I’m pleased with this and I hope it’s unanimously supported around the Council table. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p46 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, Madam Speaker, just quickly, I wanted to just say this is a great motion brought forth by the Executive Policy Committee. I don't know if it's a change of heart or not but what I would say is that we are covering off…it has been an extraordinary year in terms of a winter and the winter really started to get more severe. December was recorded as one of the worst in quite some time and of course as it proceeded, it got much worse and I know that frozen water pipes on private property has become burdensome for these people and I think that it's appropriate for us to pay up to $305 of the cost that they may have incurred, either billing from the City itself or $305 of any private, up to $305 of any private sector services bill to a home owner. So, given that, thanks to EPC for bringing it forth and I’ll be supporting this wholeheartedly and there’s other issues we are dealing with, with this extraordinary situation with our frozen water pipes. I guess at some point it became extraordinary when it went so deep into the ground, the frost, and hopefully we can get all those pipes thawed as soon as possible. And you know, we’re moving this and, you know, this is a topic, I just wanted to publicly say that, you know, way to go, City of Winnipeg workers, our administration, for trying to deal with this never before faced problem in this type of extreme. And a lot of good solid work has been happening and rather than spending time on dealing with maybe false information in the media, I think it's important to note that our workers, the people providing the service to the citizens of Winnipeg, have just been out there pounding away, trying to improve their means to unfreeze people's water pipes because you know, after all, nobody wants anybody to go without water for any period of time because I’m sure that we all know and so does every City worker know that, you know, you need water in your home to get through day to day. So I’ll leave it at that. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Just quickly again, you know, as we know, we have some 311 staff, new staff coming on that are in the crowd here and I just think it's really important that we as a Council stand behind our staff. This has been an incredible winter. It's been very challenging, often staff get beaten up by a frustrated public, by us as Councillors, by everybody. And they have been working extraordinary hours. Many of our staff have been working ridiculous amounts of overtime to deal with the frozen pipes, the snow clearing and everything and you know, they have to go home to their families and deal with their lives. And so I just wanted to say a word of support to our staff, to our administration and to EPC for doing something, taking a step to help our citizens through this as well. We are all in this together. It's pretty</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, any further speakers? I’ll call the question. All those in favour? Oh, pardon me, Mr. Mayor.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you,, Madam Speaker. First of all, I just want to put something on the record and I actually thank Councillor Eadie for bringing it up. The comments by some Councillors as well as the media, a change of heart by EPC. There was no change of heart because there was never decision made by EPC. It was the administration who basically changed the policy and then if you check the records, it was actually Councillor Browaty who I believe was the first Councillor to actually make a suggestion/recommendation about refunding money, then there was a motion at another committee and then we had a Council seminar and EPC actually had discussion on it and as I reported to all of the media, the key thing was to do what's fair and what's right, treat people like you want people to treat you, and most importantly trying to create an even playing field and that's how December 1 came up. When we had the discussion on this item, there were only a few of us left at the Council seminar unfortunately, but the idea came up of cutting off…someone gets compensated for January 2, but that person on December 29 is left in the cold. We’ve also reiterated what every day you picked, Madam Speaker, it’s not a perfect world we’ll be living, not everybody is going to be happy, but I believe with this motion, we are definitely doing the right thing. The other scenario is I very much want to echo the comments of both Councillor Eadie and Councillor Gerbasi. Our staff, our administration, has done yeoman’s work above and beyond. We’ve heard how they are going 24/7 and only taking time off to basically repair the equipment. Our administration has been meeting on weekends, weeknights, et cetera and I think it's much more positive as Councillor Gerbasi said to basically work together as opposed to criticizing. Criticizing and blaming someone is always easy thing to do. This is situation where everybody, whether it's 311 staff, whether it’s water and waste staff, whether it’s Public Works, whether it's the administration, whether it’s Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic, on and on and on, everybody is working together on this. I also want to thank Randy Hull who’s been leading this process. This is something that's very unique and I believe you’ll see a motion where we will be asking…we are declaring this a disaster and asking…there is a motion at the Council to make that decision. This is a scenario that there will be significant monies expended by the City of Winnipeg. This is a very positive motion. It's trying to do what's fair and right and hopefully this will be approved by all members of Council. Thank you.</P>

I would encourage anyone in the crowd to talk to Mr. Sanders to get Mr. Baird’s story of how we got the roof on the Pan Am Pool in the 60s, which is quite a tale, but for this item, I must declare conflict and leave the chamber.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>So noted, thank you.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’ll move that Item 2 be adopted.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Any speakers? Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Aquatic Hall of Fame offers a wonderful showcase, and the issue of how to and where to house them has been ongoing at least since I’ve been on Council. I know I’ve heard of it and I’m sure that Councillors who have been here much longer have heard about it. And you know, I’m reluctantly supportive of the report as it is. I mean, it seems to make the best case scenario out of a less than desirable situation. I was hoping that the Mayor could clarify in his closing comments perhaps about why funds are coming out of aquatics programming if in fact they are towards this, and why the changeover happened in 2006. I would be most interested in just having that piece clarified. I am supportive of it though, on the whole. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p36 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Chair. We had a seminar on this issue and I am happy that it is getting resolved, having that piece there sitting empty which is a wonderful part of the Pan Am Pool, it's horrible, when we need to be maximizing our resource uses. The problem I have and I still have and I feel it's unfortunate, but I don't see at this point where I have any other options, is the other uses that possibly could’ve been used for that facility and trying to find other ways to accommodate the Aquatics Hall of Fame within the Pan Am building. We are starting up the Grant Park</P>

<P class="p19 ft4">Recreational Hub Plan<SPAN class="ft11">, </SPAN>so I was eyeing that space for potentially a gym, a high performance gym for the aquatic centre so we can have those athletes there. We’re looking at maybe a library in there, looking at other things that would be much more engaging, I believe than the Aquatics Hall of Fame. I think the Aquatics Hall of Fame could’ve been incorporated within the modeling. It seems to be a lot of space. They seem to be getting it for a very low price while I understand that back in the day, part of the funding for the…whatever the boat, I guess they call it, was in part because of the Aquatics Hall of Fame we got it. That’s the point where I have to back down and say, well, a deal is a deal. They helped us get that site. I just wish that we could’ve worked in a way that that whole site would’ve maybe more utilized for other purposes than just a hall of fame. It's just such a beautiful site, however, that said, I see that we are at the point now in the process where there really isn't a lot talks since. I do want to say, I believe the City erred quite a bit when we kicked them out of them there in the first place, however, this is dealing with that issue. Will it be a horrible thing to have them there? Absolutely not. I’m sure it’ll be very beautiful. It will be very…it will be… it will enhance the Pan Am Pool itself. It's just unfortunate that we could’ve…maybe worked out a better deal that would’ve utilized that site and also accommodated them at that time, but again, I wasn't involved with the negotiations so this is where we're at today. So I will be supporting it, but I just want to put on record, I will be working with the group to see what other usage or how we can actually enhance their space with other community, maybe rental space, I’m not sure what, but I’ll be meeting with them as well to incorporate it in the Grand Park Hub Plan.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’m rising because I don't wish to support this item. Sorry, it doesn't pass my reasonableness test and the last item I think was close to not passing my reasonableness test either. It seems to me that back in whatever the year was when this happened we believed that we were in the right. We were not scared of the lawsuit at that time. I don't think it's appropriate that we spend $850,000 to try and walk away from an argument that we believe we are in the right on. You know, people throwing around numbers like $21 million or five point something million dollars and you know that's an argument to be had in court. And you know, I’ve got this line that I’d like to use and “it's never reward the undesired behaviour”. And to me when somebody tries these tactics, you’ve got to go to all lengths to ensure that when we make decision that we consider to be in the citizens’ best interests and when we do it with legal advice at the time, that we’re willing to back that up. I understand the value of an aquatics hall of fame but you know the relationship broke down and it broke down for a reason. And I think that’s the argument that should be had in court. So I won’t be supporting this…you know, I understand this is quick and easy and for the most part painless. I don’t…I don’t agree with the measures of risk here. I think the risk of going to court is far less. What you would have to compensate for is not what is outlined in this report. If my understanding how things are adjudicated on and how damages are found, would be correct. So I in good conscience cannot support spending this 800,000 or $850,000 at this time.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Speaker Sharma, Madam Speaker, sorry. You know, this sounds like it was a long carried out situation where there was an original contract going way back when, I think it started around 1967 and was established in I think it was in 1972 or 3. There was an obligation that the City committed to and for me, I don't see it as a…we're calling this a quick, easy resolution to a problem and to think that the perspective that we were going to win in court. I think that what this is, is a reasonable, negotiated agreement to maintain and continue the museum at the Pan Am Pool facility and it is important to have…I believe, strongly in all our museums and you know, if I think at the time, if Mayor Juba entered into an agreement, there is an agreement and I’m glad that we’re moving ahead with this and yeah it's too bad that you know we can't use or utilize it for other sporting type of activities. Those sorts of things around the Pan Am Pool, but you know the reality is, is that the Pan Am Pool is and was the place of two Pan Am Games and swimming and I think that it's important to acknowledge that at this facility. So I will be voting for this agreement. Nothing is as simple as some people might want to make it out to be. So I’m glad that we’re moving ahead and continuing in agreement that we had with the museum people, going way back even before the amalgamations of our 13 cities. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Seeing none, Mr. Mayor or Councillor Smith?</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>This has been going along for some time and I think it has to be resolved. And I’m speaking on my behalf as well as Councillor Gerbasi. If she was here, she would be supporting this as well. So let's…you know, let's get it over with. You know, this is a beautiful space. It could be used in many, many ways, but the Aquatic Hall of Fame is worthwhile and people will visit and it's a worthwhile endeavour. And this has been going on so many years, it's about time we resolved it. So let's all support this and get it out of the way.</P>

<P class="p53 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you very much. First of all, I think I’ll start with a reminder to all members of Council. When we have a Council seminar and we have all the administration there with all the parties involved in this process, that would be a very appropriate time to ask any questions you may have because that's where everybody is and that's why we had the seminar just the other day. So that's number one, just a friendly reminder to everybody. But what I will state in response to some of the questions that have come and statements. First of all, the money comes out of the Property Planning and Development capital budget. So that's one thing and number two, this whole thing started because the real question or debate or disagreement came as to who is actually responsible for the insurance. That's what started this whole situation. And in the situation we’re in right now, the City will <NOBR>self-insure</NOBR> which will save us significant money. The money that’s being spent will construct the display fixtures for all of the paraphernalia that's part of the Aquatic Hall of Fame. In addition to that, the City will own all of the fixtures and that's exactly what's going on here. And I must add, other than Councillor Swandel at the Councillor seminar where we had I believe 13 members of Council, everybody, whether they were a hundred percent supportive or 60 percent supportive and I do agree with the Councillor from River Heights, Councillor Orlikow who made the comment that it's unfortunate, but there are going to be some groups that will be displaced and to me that is an issue and that will have to be rectified, but everybody was in concurrence with this and I certainly hope that's the same today and I will close with that.</P>

<P class="p56 ft1">Moved by His Worship Mayor Katz,</P>
<P class="p56 ft1">Seconded by Councillor Wyatt,</P>
<P class="p44 ft12">WHEREAS the City of Winnipeg has experienced and continues to experience a disaster as a result of a sudden and dramatic increase in frozen water pipes due to a prolonged period of frigid temperatures and <NOBR>deeper-than-usual</NOBR> frost penetration into the ground;</P>
<P class="p24 ft12">AND WHEREAS the number of frozen water pipes already reported this winter greatly exceeds the average number of frozen water pipes experienced each winter, and the number of frozen water pipes is anticipated to increase over the next two months;</P>

<P class="p44 ft12">AND WHEREAS the costs being incurred by the City of Winnipeg to thaw the frozen water pipes and to provide alternate sources of water greatly exceed its anticipated and budgeted costs for these services;</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">AND WHEREAS when a disaster strikes and creates an unforeseeable financial burden, Disaster Financial Assistance may be made available by the Province of Manitoba to a municipality when the eligible costs incurred resultant from a disaster exceed the amount which any one municipality may reasonably be expected to bear on its own;</P>
<P class="p24 ft12">AND WHEREAS in order for the Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization to consider an application for disaster financial assistance, the application must be supported by a resolution passed by the municipality;</P>
<P class="p35 ft12">THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City of Winnipeg request the Province of Manitoba to provide disaster financial assistance for costs related to Frozen Pipes in the City of Winnipeg in 2014 in accordance with their established policies and guidelines.</P>

<P class="p18 ft1">March 26, 2014</P>
<P class="p58 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, as I think everybody has heard, this is an extremely unique situation. The number of days we’ve had <NOBR>-30</NOBR> weather plus, the depth of the frost which is now getting to 8 feet in certain areas, the number of homes that have frozen water lines and the number of homes that have basically lines that we are supplying temporary water which is solving the problem until we can get out there. I think we already talked about and many Councillors reiterated, the amount of effort and energy and hard work that's going into this by all our staff as well. This is a very unique situation. There is very little doubt in my mind. This will exceed millions of dollars, okay, could easily be between three and five millions of dollars. We don't know where this is going to end, et cetera. In some of the numbers we’re putting out there, we’re actually guessing and usually when you guess, Madam Speaker, it's much higher. So this is a scenario where we should go forward and ask for this and wait for a response. We don't gain anything by waiting. We lose nothing by going forward right now. The bottom line is we will spend much more than $1 per person which is the criteria, about $730,000 is what we have to spend. We will exceed that and after that the other levels of government, you know, come into play if this is approved. So from my point of view, this is something we should very much do and I do thank Councillor Wyatt for seconding the motion.</P>
<P class="p59 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p36 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. This is new information. I obviously read about this in the last couple of days in the paper and I know this motion came here today. I’m not going to be supporting this. I think that this…I’m not saying, you know, in time it doesn't make sense to do it, just from the information that I’ve gotten, the only information that I had is that there’s…with the Council motion today, there is somewhere in the round of $200,000 additional costs. We know that there will be some additional costs in terms of running the water that are there. I think that we definitely have time to take a look at this. Let’s see what the costs are. I think the disaster, I understand with the criterias for it. There is really only one taxpayer. I do want to make sure what the costs are and does…is it appropriate for the City to do it? It seems maybe to a certain extent, a little bit overreach right now in terms of applying for this. I think that there is a lot of time left. I haven't seen, once again, some cost estimates on the rest of the pieces that could be there. I know there was, you know, thank goodness for our firefighters. They did a great job delivering some of the water and opening up their facilities. I know that it was a lot of work time costs were put in there as well. You know, and I think the City has done a reasonably good job for the most part on I think, as one could argue, you know, some of the pre- planning could’ve been looked at a little bit more thorough. You can never, you know, <NOBR>pre-judge</NOBR> what the weather is going to do, but my concern is at this point, without knowing the financial piece, really, every year you could say, well, you know, it's something that’s going to cost over $700,000 just because of the snow removal that's there. So I think this is a little bit early in terms of our process to do it. There is time later on to do it right now. And with that, I won't be supporting it, but I do want to wait to see what the final cost for the bills are. At that point if it's appropriate, if it's millions or tens of millions of dollars that's something I would consider as a disaster response that is appropriate. But I think this is a little bit of an overreach right now until we know what the dollars and cents are so I won't be supporting this motion.</P>
<P class="p60 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will be supporting this. I think it’s essential. In fact, I have publicly said that as well. I think it shows that we are forward thinking. We’re not naive to think that these expenses aren’t going to be adding up. We’ve had two Council seminars where we’ve gotten a lot of information and from the information that's out in the media as well, I believe the Director of Water and Waste has said running the water per resident is $500 for that three month period. So we have 6200 people out there and that number is growing of people running their water. That alone is $3 million. And if that's in fact an eligible expense, I don't know why wouldn’t be moving forward with this. As well, when I talk to the Water and Waste staff who are out there, who are working. You know, in fact, there was a couple of workers just at the home right behind my home last night at 9:00 o'clock. They’re working long shifts around the clock. We’d be naive to think that that overtime isn’t going to be adding up and at the end of the year, we’re going to see that overtime staffing costs are well over budget. The thawing pipes motion just now we heard is at $210,000. Well, what if that is higher indeed, and we’re, you know, there are more claims out there from private service providers, maybe more people than we anticipated jump to going to the private service providers and, you know, the next motion which I’ll be asking for suspension on could lead to more costs. So I think we’re already in the ballpark if these expenses are indeed eligible. So I would hope that the information that we have at hand although not in a detailed report, that we’ve heard at Council seminars that we heard in the media is actually going to contribute to this cost and we’re well over this now. So those are my comments, thank you.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’m sort of along the same thinking as Councillor Fielding is. I think we're a little premature and I’m not sure we really thought this well through. I don't know if given the motion that we just passed where we’re now taking the burden away from private property where damages or the frozen pipes are on private property and paying for those ourselves if we’ve actually eliminated some of the criteria that we would…we</P>

<P class="p43 ft4">would actually have citizens applying for disaster financial assistances if it was…if it was to be considered. I remind Councillors, you know, this is sort of the stuff that we’ve got to be careful that we need to stay on proper information here. The resident cost of running water is not the cost to the utility of running water so we’ve got to stop exaggerating things. You know, in reality, we have 692 or 672 homes right now that don't have water. Some people are finding alternative ways to dealing with their situations. I know in one particular case, a young family, they live right across the street from their parents’ home. It’s very easy for them to manage their lives and they choose not to do the cross connection hookup and they manage and they’ll wait. The City of Winnipeg is providing for people in a number of different ways. The other thing that might…also you might want to also take into consideration is the big expense that we probably have this year is the unusual amount of broken water mains. That cost is going to greatly exceed, I believe, the cost of thawing frozen pipes. The frequency, the number, the damages to streets and property when you get that kind of amount of water flowing on the street, you see the damages happening to some of the streets and we don't know what’s going to be left on the boulevards. Those are the types of things that we want to consider and we could consider them further down the road when we actually have a handle on the numbers. I guess, you know, the Mayor may be right that there’s no harm in putting this forward at this time. I don't know that. I think, you know, you'll sort of get some response from the people that do this on a regular basis and I think we've already had…Randy Hull made a comment on this earlier on that this situation, as far as frozen pipes wouldn't rise to the level of what would be considered under the eligible criteria for disaster financial assistance. I don't know since that comment was made, if the scenario has changed that much. So, you know, I’m not going to support the motion. I just don't think that the time is right. I don't think we have enough proper information in front of us and I don't understand how the Province will consider this now and if they refuse it now, can we still go back afterwards? So for me, it's a better understanding of what the criteria are and whether or not we’ve actually included enough in this motion to be considered.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. In our discussions about this motion and I said it when we were talking about the $305 reimbursement or for private side pipes. This…you know, we heard it again this winter. I don't know how, I guess you could plan for what we could call basically it is an extraordinary situation which in a way is a disaster. I don't know how we could’ve planned way ahead for something like this, but it's clear that if the environmental climate specialists say that this is the situation, if we're going to be facing more of this really deep ground freezing, we should be planning better for that through our emergency measures. We become very good at planning for floods which are extraordinary situations when it gets to a certain level of flooding, just like the frost getting to a certain level down into the ground. I don't see a big difference. And you know, frankly, you know, there are a lot of homes in the City of Winnipeg and you might say…one might say that a fraction of the reported frozen water…possible frozen water pipes and a number I think the total possible was something like 6500, I can't remember the exact number, where we do have people running water and doing those kinds of things and the kind of adaptation that we’ve had to do with the equipment to unthaw pipes kind of…is reminiscent of coming up with this new…what did they call that huge dike they built south of the City of Winnipeg to protect a large portion. They were inventive, right? So to me, I think the conditions are here and this motion, just so everybody understands this, that we have emergency measures planners and kudos goes out to Randy Hull. We know that the City of Winnipeg has dealt with applying for disaster under the sink to the Province of Manitoba and whoever it needs to go to. We’ve done that in the past and it was being considered. We sat in the seminar just this week, I think. Was that this week, Mayor? We sat in a seminar and we heard that you know there’s been a lot of consideration into what this motion is and as the Mayor said, you know, there’s nothing to lose either way, to move ahead with this, to try to apply for it. So I…you know, I get really concerned that again we’re trying to depict that somehow we’ve got this motion that really hasn't been seriously considered. It has been seriously considered by our experts in administration. We had it reported and explained to us in length in a seminar and so I will be supporting this motion today to move ahead with it and I just want to say once again, like when you listen to the worst winters in Winnipeg, we're going way back, you know, we could keep going back. If it's still…keeps, like it's still pretty cold out there and so and if the farmer's almanac is right, in September we're going to get winter again. So we need to be cognizant of this and thanks for moving this motion, the mover and seconder and I’ll be supporting. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Wyatt followed by Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the Mayor for moving this motion. I don't know why somebody would try to politicize this motion. This is a pretty straightforward motion, Madam Speaker. The Disaster Financial Assistance Program exists for situations like this. It was set up jointly between the provinces and the Federal government to assist municipalities across the country for unforeseen events. This is an event. We’ve had temperatures that in the month of December alone can only be predated back to the 1800s. If you don't want to call this a disaster, Madam Speaker, I guess that's your choice, but frankly, I believe that the cost and the extent of this is maybe not the equivalent of a potential flood to the city, but nevertheless, to the people that it's impacting directly, it is a disaster. It’s having a direct impact on our municipality in terms of costs and I cite the disaster financial assistance formula that</P>

After that, the next dollar to $3 is a 50 percent share of the Provincial government, 50 percent share of the municipality in terms of cost, following $3 to $5, it's 75 percent Provincial share, 25 percent municipal share and following that over $5, 100 percent Provincial share, zero percent municipal share. In fact, the Provincial government is also receiving funds back, backing up their money so that they’re not a hundred percent on the hook for the funding from the Federal government for these types of disasters. For anybody to try to politicize something as basic as this, I cannot fathom it, Madam Speaker. This is a program that exists for municipalities to access across this country for disasters and unforeseen events. This is an unforeseen event, Madam Speaker. The last time it happened was 35 years ago and if you ask people last year, could they have ever seen something like this happening? No, because frankly, 35 years ago is ancient history in today's modern world unfortunately. So, Madam Speaker, this is a program that's there to be accessed.

<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Councillor Wyatt I think put it very well. I mean this is unforeseen and unheard of. I mean, in my life, I don't remember a winter that's gone on this long and this cold. There are rules and criterias with the Disaster Financial Assistance Program. In the past, there have been a lot of expenses when we’ve had flooding emergencies and such that were eligible, but there were also costs that weren't eligible and Councillor Swandel should know that you’re right, some of the costs incurred change in the dates on that. There will be some costs and incurred and some not. For any of the 311 folks that are leaving, thank you for all of your work, but the reality is we’ve had a lot of people coming in whether it's in our call centre, in our Water and Waste Department. Those are real costs and those are costs that are probably eligible for disaster financial assistance. These are unexpected and unforeseen circumstances. The last 60 days, we’ve had water and works crews working 16 to 18 hour days, we’re being told by our administrators. And again, these are going to be very substantial. I’m surprised that two former finance chairs that are speaking out against this. They realize the impact of like, you know, $5 million, $8 million hit, I mean, there’s several points to the property tax base if we were to pass this on as one time to residents. Otherwise, I mean we’re paying for it regardless. It goes through on our water bills if it goes through municipally. Again, this is an unforeseen and epic event and I certainly support this motion today.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Mr. Mayor to close.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I must confess I was extremely surprised to hear some of the comments. First of all, let me remind everybody, the biggest problem that the City of Winnipeg has with this type of issue or any infrastructure issue you want to talk about, is out of every dollar of tax that the three levels of government collect, 65 cents goes to the Provincial government, 27 cents to the Federal government and 8 cents to us. If somebody doesn't understand the value of using what was created for these types of situations then I’d like to spend some time with you <NOBR>one-on-one</NOBR> and maybe I can explain it. On top of that, take this situation, Madam Speaker, and compare it to the flood of 2011 or the flood of 2009. Unless you were one of those homes in the floodplain or right on the river, you wouldn't have known there was a flood going on and I know that Councillor Swandel worked really hard to help and protect his citizens' greatest assets and yet it's about 30 times more the number of people that are being impacted right now. Those are the realities. Those are the realities and something else that people should learn. 1997 was when the flood hit us. We weren't prepared, but we reacted and everybody pulled together and did the best we can. As a result of learning from that, that's why we’ve been so successful with the past floods from the experience that our staff have learned and are dealing with it and I can assure you the same will be true with this situation. They will learn from this and that's why you will not see the same extent in the future. But there are real costs and even the water, as Councillor Swandel mentioned, might not be a real cost. Let me tell you, treating that water when it comes in and treating it when it goes back is a real cost. All that overtime is a real cost. All that thawing is a real cost. There are plenty of real cost and when we do this what happens is that a department will put together a very thorough report and they will be the ones submitting this. I don't understand why anybody would not support this motion.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. I’ll call the question. All those in favour? Recorded vote. Okay. All those in favour, please rise.</P>

<P class="p65 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Motion carried. Okay, we have Motion No. 2, which is from Councillor Havixbeck and Councillor Smith dealing with…regarding the hotel rooms and frozen water lines.</P>
<P class="p41 ft1">Motion No. 2</P>
<P class="p56 ft1">Moved by Councillor Havixbeck,</P>
<P class="p56 ft1">Seconded by Councillor Smith,</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">WHEREAS citizens have the right to access water in their homes;</P>
<P class="p66 ft12">AND WHEREAS the recent emergency situation where approximately 720 addresses throughout the City of Winnipeg still do not have municipal water nor do they have access to a neighbour’s temporary connection for water;</P>
<P class="p35 ft12">THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT citizens be afforded the option of staying at a hotel or a bed and breakfast within the City of Winnipeg until either a temporary connection can be established or their pipes can be thawed and regular service resumes;</P>
<P class="p24 ft12">AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the Public Service be directed to negotiate a bulk discount with hoteliers and offer a rate similar to airlines offering rates to passengers when they need to layover.</P>
<P class="p41 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I’d like to move suspension of the rules to hear this item now.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>All those in favour of suspending the rules? All those opposed? Okay, we will hear the item.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Okay, thank you, Madam Speaker. I’ll just read this for those who may not have a copy or who can't see it. Whereas citizens have the right to access water in their homes; Whereas the recent emergency situation where approximately 720 addresses throughout the City of Winnipeg still do not have municipal water nor do they have access to a neighbour's temporary connection for water; Therefore be it resolved that citizens be afforded the option of staying at a hotel or a bed and breakfast within the City of Winnipeg until either a temporary connection can be established or their pipes can be thawed and regular service resumes; And therefore be it resolved that the Public Service be directed to negotiate a bulk discount with hoteliers and offer a rate similar to what airlines offer passengers when they need to layover. So Madam Speaker, I bring this forward and I thank Councillor Smith for supporting this motion. You know, there are 720 residences without water connection. Some have declined the temporary hose connection, but this is geared towards those and we do not have the numbers. I’m afraid I asked that question at the Council seminar the other day, how many simply cannot have it. There’s a resident near me who could not obtain a connection, a temporary connection, four weeks without water. You know, I think that as a parent and one who does about 20 loads of laundry in a week, you know, kids, families, elderly people, I know I as a Councillor have heard from residents who are <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> who may be you know have…can't toilet properly even, carry even carry the water to the toilet because of physical impairment. I’m concerned about these people. I know that the City is doing everything in its capacity with firefighters, with Community Services emergency workers who are invaluable at helping those that I’ve just mentioned. But I think that if we could just have this as an option, I think it would be beneficial. You know, I’ve had a couple of conversations with the Mayor about this and others who say that perhaps nobody would really want this. Well, maybe some do and I think as a City, we should at least afford residents the opportunity to say, no if they don't want it. If they want to stay in their homes and function as is. There are a number of bed and breakfasts in our city. It's a low season time of year right now so I wouldn't…I would imagine that they’re not very busy. Hoteliers have also reached out to Council. So you know, I just think that it's an option that wouldn't be an extraordinary cost lines to have as an option to residents. So I hope there will be support around the table for it.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I won't be supporting this motion for today. I think that obviously the situation that people are facing is a great concern for Winnipeggers. I think that over the last few weeks, the City has stepped up to the plate and done a good job communicating and, you know, all that. You could argue that maybe the</P>

<P class="p67 ft6">response was a little bit late, but that's here nor there. We’ve got to make sure we’re taking care of people. Any calls that I’ve had with frozen water pipes, they’ve been answered really effectively, forwarded on to Diane Sacher and whomever else. They get the answers they need. I have to say that I have had a number of calls from residents but I haven't had anyone call me to ask for a hotel stay. That's just not something that I’ve received any phone calls on. I think what we need to do is focus on what the City is currently focusing on, fixing the problem, getting it resolved and I think that's got to be the focus right now as opposed to a motion before us. So I won't be supporting this motion and thank you.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think that this motion as I heard it, is you know, it's close because the numbers are changing every day, but 720 approximately residents and there’s different reasons for those people to have not had any water service to this point in terms of hooking up to a neighbour or what have you. But I think that this motion in itself is open to allow our administration that if a family or individual needs to utilize…wants to utilize the services of a hotel room or bed and breakfast, that…you know, they can…we can try to qualify it in terms of what is the specific reason that, you know, they…this particular house doesn't have water service because there are rumours out there that, you know, maybe we don't hook up and have water service because our pipes might get thawed out beforehand. I don't know what's going on out there, but…so of those 720, you know, the odds are that it's not all those people that will…I’ll say require a hotel room because, you know, some people do have family that they can stay with, but others don't. Others…I have had some calls and there is a particular situation in my ward where the family is not able to get temporary water hook up and is really living kind of not a very good life, having water transported and so on. You are not having a warm shower, I don’t think, if you are getting the firefighters or anybody carting water in. I’m not quite sure how that works. So, you know, I offered my place up to that family and, you know, they don't want to impose. They don't want to impose because...you know, these…the use of water is very personal and private. Remember that, people, when we use water it's very personal, private things we do with water. And, you know, sometimes the only alternative is a hotel room. And so I think this is open enough, this motion for administration to make a judgment as to whether or not there is a real need of potentially one of these 720 homes. And so I will be supporting this motion today because I think there is…and it may…I don't know what the number is, yes we should do some calculations. We have former Finance Chairs, yes. And contrary to popular belief, I am actually a frugal person. I have a Scottish background and have lived on very little money in many times of my life and so you get frugal and you really need to be careful. But again, I believe that this motion is open enough to allow our City's administration to make a judgment and I don't think that the exposure is as high as 720 to be frank with you. Because if they are going to ask for a hotel room, we'll check, maybe the neighbour will supply a water supply to them and we'll hook that up rather than giving them a…covering a hotel cost. Again, thank you, Madam Speaker, I will be supporting this motion today.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Mayes followed by Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p36 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. With some reluctance, I’m going to agree with Councillor Fielding not because it's Councillor Fielding, but everyone would like to be generous, everyone would like to be seen as doing everything they possibly can to help the people who’ve been inconvenienced by frozen pipes. I think we would all agree on it. We all pulled together pretty well earlier today to talk about the compensation, but I think Councillor Fielding makes a number of points which are we don't know the cost of this. We don't know…the way this is written and defined, there’s…what is a rate comparable to…a rate similar to airlines offering rates to passengers when they need to layover. We don't know what that is. We don't have any sort of report. I would’ve preferred to have this sent for a report back from the administration. My own sense is people want the service in their homes restored. They don't necessarily want to go to a hotel or bed and breakfast. Like Councillor Fielding, I don’t think I’ve had a single call from a resident saying, “What I’d really like to do and deserve is get to stay at a hotel or bed and breakfast.” As was indicated, the City has responded, maybe not as quickly as some would like, but we have got the firefighters and the paramedics, the paramedics would want me to point out that paramedics are also taking water around. We have the programs opened up at different pools, thanks to you, Madam Speaker for suggesting that, that our public pools offer access for showering. We have the three different emergency centres that are set up, so people do have some recourse. If you have children and there was talk about parenting, I don't think the ideal thing for you is to be lodged in a hotel at a much greater distance potentially from your kid's school or from your place of work. I think people want to be able to get the service restored in their homes. Let's concentrate on that. Let’s put our ammunition, let’s put our resources on that. We don't know what the extent of exposure here in terms of people who aren’t getting the service may have declined the service, but I do know what Mrs. Sacher said, which is we have like a one day waiting list to get the temporary connection hooked up. Sometimes it doesn't work. Some people don't want it as Councillor Swandel indicated. They might have relatives across the street, but we’re doing pretty well at getting the temporary hose connections set up and that allows you to stay in your residence. This is…this problem is going to persist for some period of time. So I think before looking at a fairly major step like putting people into hotels or bed and breakfasts, let's try to deal with problematic source, which is thawing the pipes. We’ve got people out there trying different mechanisms, water jet, different electricity methods trying to thaw the pipes. Let's keep putting the money on that rather than trying to say, “Okay, well, we'll let you</P>

We should give them all a night in a hotel. Let's give them all a night in a hotel or a bed and breakfast. Let’s get…cut their property taxes because they had a boil water advisory. Different inconveniences affect different parts of the city at different times. We didn't put people up in a hotel. We didn't put them in up in a bed and breakfast because they had a boil water advisory. It was unfortunate. I had a very good town hall meeting about it. Place was packed. Great support from City staff who came out there on their own time I might add, not charging overtime and we talked about how that happened, how we can prevent it from happening again. That's the approach I think we should take here to say let’s try to make sure this doesn't happen again to the best of our ability. Let’s try and do everything we can in the <NOBR>short-term</NOBR> though, not to be negotiating with hoteliers about bulk discount rates, but rather put, all the people who have, all the resources we have, trying to thaw people’s pipes so they can stay in their homes, send their kids to the same school and get their lives back to normal rather than taking the step.

It seems to me that if we all value water, we should be supportive of this and I suspect all the Councillors of this Council Chamber all have water and I think we should make sure that people have an option to go to a hotel.

<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Yes, I’d like to rise and thank Councillor Havixbeck for moving this motion. Someone also of Ukrainian decent, I am, like many I think Winnipeggers and Canadians, shocked with regards to what has occurred and the events that have occurred in terms of the last number of weeks. It's ironic because only days before that the world left Sochi, Russia celebrating the termination of the Olympics, the Olympic Games, the Winter Olympic Games, which I believe Russia won the most medals. Canada was number three in the standings after Norway. And you know, it's just…it was just shocking to see just shortly after that the decision made to send Russian troops into the Crimea. If you enjoy reading history or understand history, you know there is a long history here between Ukraine, between Russia and Russia has a long history of Crimea, with Crimea and there is no doubt that they may have a historical claim, but we know that in today's modern age that this is not the way for modern nations to resolve problems amongst themselves, that using brute force is something that we hoped we had moved beyond. The fact that Russia still is technically a nuclear power. That they have <NOBR>inter-continental</NOBR> ballistic missiles that could be used is gravely concerning and it’s also concerning in terms of any kind of escalation. So the motion is worded in such a way to also call on the Ukrainian government that we need to take the pressure off the situation. We cannot allow it to get worse. We cannot allow an escalation. We cannot allow any excuse to be used by…and I will call him a dictator in Russia, Mr. Putin, who, under his watch, dozens if not hundreds of journalists have disappeared. People do not have the same freedoms that we enjoy. I subscribe to…I’m a news junky. I subscribe to Russian television<SPAN class="ft13">, </SPAN>al Jazeera and I try to keep up to date, and I can tell you that Russian television, which is sponsored by the Russian Government is, for some reason, a constant tirade against the west, against NATO, revisionist history in terms of the events in Kosovo in the late 1990s. It's just absolutely remarkable to see and disturbing to see what is being argued from the point of view that wrongs have been made. And we have to remember that this year, Madam Speaker, marks the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. It was exactly 100 years ago when the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the inherer of the throne in the <NOBR>Austro-Hungarian</NOBR> Empire was assassinated in Serbia and from there sparked the events. And Russia declaring war on Austria, Austria declaring war on Russia, Germany declaring war on Russia as part of their alliance, Russia declaring war on Germany within hours, with modern technology of that time, which were trains and military plans, literally thousands upon tens of thousands of men were on trains heading towards each other and the result was 9 million dead, 15 million wounded and then in 1919 an epidemic of influenza that spread around the world. A lot of people feel it was started by the First World War because of the weakness and because of the devastation. Another 20 million people died worldwide from influenza, right even here in Canada, right across the world. And of course then the events that followed the rest of that century, that bloody century. We cannot allow, Councillors, a repeat of the last century. We’re all part of the global community. This motion is very important. We cannot allow what took place before. We, the great thing that's happening now inside Russia is, is a growing middle class. The middle class don't want to see that opportunity and prosperity and Putin is threatening that. And it is that middle class that we have to find an alliance with and hopefully be able to turn the page here and prevent any other escalation in terms of this region. So we need to send a message that there has to be calmer minds prevailing and we cannot allow this…two things. We cannot allow a hot war to actually to happen and we cannot allow another cold war, Madam Speaker, because there’s some of us in this chamber who are old enough to remember the last cold war. And now, as the files are being opened from the different governments in terms of that period of time in history, we know how many close calls there actually were and there was more close calls than we would like to think about in terms of during the Cold War at how close the world came to obliterating itself. So let us support this unanimously and pray that there will be a peaceful resolution in Eastern Europe. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Mr. Mayor.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I think the comments that were made are extremely appropriate. I certainly would hope that this motion would be supported unanimously by Council. I’d also like to put on the record that I think the actions of our Canadian Government to date have been very appropriate under the circumstances and hopefully they will continue to do that, but there’s no doubt that we should be on the record and I do thank the movers for this motion.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Councillor Havixbeck to close.</P>
<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. And thank you Councillor Wyatt for agreeing to support this motion and moving it forward today. I think it’s very timely and I hope that this will be unanimous. Many lives have already been lost in Ukraine. Those parents, those sons, daughters, they won't be coming home. Many are unaccounted for as Councillor Wyatt said, particularly reporters, but many others. I think it's important that we reflect on this, but that we also take action. We are leaders in our City, of this Council and I would like to see this supported unanimously. Our sister city, yes, is Lviv, Ukraine, located in the western area of Ukraine and having represented the City of Winnipeg and visited the Acting Deputy Mayor there about two years back in my capacity as Acting Deputy Mayor, I saw a young Council, a Council full of ambition willing to fight for their country. This sister city relationship has been strengthened and continues to go on. I think it's very important that we make a statement that we are supportive of Ukraine and Russian-</P>

<P class="p88 ft1">EXECUTIVE POLICY COMMITTEE</P>
<P class="p90 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Many of us have asked for a list of those properties within our wards that are without water so that we can check on residents, constituents. I see that as part of our work here, to care for people. On the weekend of March 8 and 9, it was reported that the Mayor visited residents who were frozen out and didn’t have water. How exactly did the Mayor know where to go? Did the Mayor follow the truck around the way the rest of us have to? How did he know where to go visit residents?</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Yes Madam Speaker, I followed the truck around as a matter of fact. I met a truck in Norwood and then I went to another one in Elmwood and I was basically with workers from the department. Then I believe I also went out to Transcona and I might add, at the same time, I spoke to these people about their situation, many of whom have been without water for two, three weeks and I can tell you Madam Speaker, and I shared this with the Councillor…not one of them wanted to leave their homes.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>

<P class="p18 ft1">March 26, 2014</P>
<P class="p77 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I would love to visit the residents in my ward, and you know, last night, I was leaving my back lane…</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Do you have a question Councillor?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes I do. This is my preamble. There were two workers from Water and Waste, as I’ve said earlier on the floor of Council…</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Point of order. This is a supplementary question. There is no <NOBR>pre-amble.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>The question please.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Would the Mayor make some effort to provide Councillors with the list of residents who are without water in their respective wards, on a confidential basis?</P>
<P class="p83 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I would like to think that any Councillor who’s in touch with their constituents and I know the Councillor just moved a motion a little while ago which unfortunately was referred to EPC, because it would have been nice to deal with it right now. Obviously you’re communicating with your constituents. They call you when they have problems. I would like to think if there are people having problems, they call their Councillor, and so you should be knowing. I get letters from people all the time and they put their phone numbers and their addresses on there, so there is a way of identifying as well as you know, several times the admin has been asked and they’ve been told that they will not do that, as a privacy matter.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Anything further? Third question?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes, can the Mayor tell us what is the status of the Open Data Initiative brought forward last year?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I can let you know that I was asked this question before by the Councillor and she already has asked the administration and they have responded by email, so if she would just read her email the answer would be there.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Yes, you know I was going to ask about, you know, the residents in terms of frozen pipes and I think you’ve done a good job Mr. Mayor in terms of that over the years, but to be fair, I did have a call from someone in St. James and they had said that you had phoned them as opposed to visiting them, so, you know, Councillor Havixbeck’s question is…it’s an appropriate question to ask. I mean, I wasn’t…I asked the CAO of the City of Winnipeg and he said we can’t get that information because as a Ward Councillor I’d like to know who in my ward is there. They had contacted my office and so I responded back to them, calling them, but they had said that they received a phone call from you that weekend, so the question is fairly relevant what Councillor Havixbeck asked.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I think the answer is quite simple. Like the Councillor got an email, I got one too and I guess I called before the Councillor and spoke to them and had a good conversation with them, so as I said earlier, this just proves the point. Councillors and the Mayor are getting emails or phone calls and I would assume you are responding to those people. I know I try my best to do that and I guess there’s a perfect example.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>I’ll take the Mayor at his word for that.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Sure. Second question, another topic, Building Canada funds. There’s a story in the Free Press…I think it’s the Free Press or one of the media outlets talking about extension of Chief Peguis. I very much support that. Could you identify what your priorities would be for the Building Canada funds monies that are coming available over the next year or year and a half?</P>
<P class="p92 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Mayor Katz</SPAN>: Unfortunately, I thank the Councillor, and through you, I’m not aware of the article but I’m sure it’s been there if the Councillors says it was there. To me, I know that there are…it’s not what my priorities are. What I would do is ask the department for their priorities and then Council would discuss this and move forward. Obviously as you know, in</P>

<P class="p43 ft4">the past, with Building Canada funds, it’s been mutual agreement by all three levels of government. I’ve also heard some rumours that that could change. I’m not aware of all the details but I heard several rumblings that the way it was done in the past might be different. But I will share this: that I know that Chief Peguis has been mentioned on many occasions. I know that the Provincial Government is extremely supportive of it. Those are facts and I’m happy to share with that. By the same token, there’s obviously…there’s Waverley underpass which comes up and I’m sure you’ve seen that in the media as well. There’s many, many projects. There’s William R. Clement Parkway that comes up. There’s no shortage of projects for us to do. I think it’s imperative that we let our people come up with the priorities and that we have that discussion and I’m hoping that Building Canada is done the same way as it has in the past, but as I say, we haven’t seen any of the details as yet, but I do thank the Councillor for that question.</P>
<P class="p59 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Third question Councillor?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Sure, one final question, and I agree with you on the Waverley underpass. It’s something that definitely needs to be done. Would you facilitate either through a Council seminar or bringing to the floor of Council, so all members of Council can have a vote on what the priorities should be for those Building Canada funds.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I have no problem bringing to Council a discussion, having a Council seminar, etc. I think the first thing we need to do is find out how much money we have available. Right now no one knows the exact amount of money. That will decide whether we can do one project, two projects, three projects. We don’t know at this stage of the game, but I don’t think that is…that’s very reasonable. I have no problem having a discussion with Council.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further questions? Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p83 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Thank you. Mr. Mayor, my first question is regarding…looking at my notes here…regarding the impact on the removal of the community services, specifically the decision to eliminate the Community Resource Coordinators and Community Development staff to most of the City. It’s been brought to my attention and some other Councillors from those community groups that relied on that support on the impact that it’s actually having on them, on their ability to connect with different groups, to be able to support the City on coordinating all these pieces. So simple question, now that the impact is starting to be seen, is there any desire or movement within the City to start trying to fill in those gaps either with alternative staff or through community services, where we can still sort of help with that community development model, even though we’ve reduced those staff positions.</P>
<P class="p26 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to Councillor Orlikow, actually it was just sometime this week I actually received a letter…it was forwarded to me by Councillor Gerbasi and I’m sure it’s the same letter that Councillor Orlikow is referring to…where a group just recently discovered this scenario. I mean I think we were talking about it in November but they were just made…they…I guess they found out about it just recently which I think is extremely unfortunate. Keep something in mind, whatever decision Council makes, Council always has the ability and the power to change it. So if that’s a discussion that the Councillor wants to bring to the table, it certainly is fair game and obviously if that’s what he feels I would have no problem with having a discussion on that.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Mr. Mayor, can you tell me if you know regarding the Investors Group Stadium of any community involvement there? I know we lost the dome…I can’t preamble. I know we have the…but we’ve lost the dome. What kind of community access is going on at the Investor Group Stadium right now or at all?</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to the Councillor, with the dome no longer being reality, which was supposed to have a phenomenal amount of amateur sport playing there and a lot of groups using it, the only one that I’m aware of right now is I do know that minor…well I know the Bisons obviously are there and I think they do have some other high school football games. I’m not aware of others. There certainly could very well be and I would be happy to, you know, get back to the Councillor to find out if there are any other events because I’m just not aware of all those other events.</P>
<P class="p94 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>Last question. Real easy one. Can you tell myself and Council and the City how we’re going to be dealing with potholes?</P>
<P class="p95 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, we’re dealing with potholes. We deal with potholes every single year. We’ve been dealing with them for…how many decades for now, but the realities are the department has been out there. I know that a few, about nine or ten days ago, they had nine or ten crews out there. That’s number one. Number two, when the weather warms up, they do go out there and they basically use a different system. I can also share with you that I was</P>

<P class="p19 ft4">on a radio show where someone came up, was mentioned how infrared is being used. It’s being used in Edmonton and I believe New Hampshire and I didn’t know anything about it. I can tell you that our staff checked into it. That system did not work with Edmonton and they got rid of the equipment, so…and I can tell you like anybody else, anytime you talk to people in the industry, I always ask them, is there nothing new out there, etc. Unfortunately we do live in a climate where we go from one extreme to the other, you know, plus 40, minus 40 and this is just the nature of the beast. I know that the department, and I want this to be very, very clear…that our department is always communicating with people right throughout North American on a regular basis. So if there’s something out there that’s better than what we’re doing, they would know about it and they would bring it forward, and to this date that hasn’t happened, but if that opportunity does exist, I can assure you that the department would be on it, yours truly would support it and I believe all of Council would support it, so they’re always looking. In the meantime, you know, we do have the hot fills that we use when the weather warms up and we have crews out there doing the temporary fills.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt. </SPAN>Thank you. Mr. Mayor, on a completely different subject…the…as you know I’m a strong supporter of rapid transit as you are and yes, Councillor Fielding, come back. You want to hear the question being a strong supporter of rapid transit yourself. It’s come to my attention that…and I’m a strong supporter of rapid transit. I’m also a strong supporter of our process here, our democratic process in terms of our budget and what we as a Council have agreed to do or not to do in terms of the southwest corridor and it’s come to my attention that Council’s alignment that Council approved in terms of southwest corridor that there potentially are new costs that are arising that is driving up the cost of the project in terms of rail line relocation as well as grade separations in terms of those rail lines, and I’m a bit of an expert now unfortunately on grade separations and rail lines, and I know exactly how much those costs can be and how high they can go up. I guess my concern Mr. Mayor is one of, first of all, we’re filing an application to the Federal Government in terms of their P3 status. It would almost seem incumbent if there is a major…if there is a change in the scope of the project and costs related to it that the Acting CAO be reporting back to Council in terms of those costs prior to any applications or at least finalization of applications before Council.</P>
<P class="p44 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I thank…through you, I thank Councillor Wyatt for the question. I very much believe that rapid transit is important. There’s no secret that I’ve always been a fan of light rail transit. I think that’s what will motivate and inspire everyone to get on side. By the same token, with what we’re doing right now, we do have the ability to convert it which to me is extremely important to know. The Councillor is correct about the fact that we have…we are in the process of putting an application in to the Federal Government for $150 million which is an integral part of this project coming to place. As he obviously knows, the Jubilee underpass as well as the Calrossie situation are also part of it and I can also share with the Councillor that we’re also having dialogue right now with the Provincial Government about certain railway lines where there might be an opportunity to remove them from within the City and get them to an area that’s not going to cause the same grief and aggravation that’s caused by them. I can also tell you that I’m hoping to go to Ottawa and have the bigger conversation, because if you want to move rail lines, you need to have Ottawa on side, and so I’m happy to let the Councillor know that. I don’t have any details right now about the costs escalating. I know the numbers that we’re looking at but I’m happy to look into that as well.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you. This is more of kind of a “are you aware” question. At the last Finance meeting, the Finance Committee moved that requesting the Winnipeg Public Service have a presentation at the Finance meeting in terms of the capital integration project and in terms of…which is a $600 million estimated project which is the 450 now being estimated for the BRT, roughly 50 million for the Calrossie/Cockburn upgrades and the 100 million balance which is the Jubilee upgrade and in light of the fact that this has been requested, is it possible, rather than a presentation at the Finance Committee, as all members of Council are not members of the Finance Committee, that maybe a Council seminar be conducted instead of that and that would allow all members of Council to participate and ask questions, and it’s just a suggestion.</P>
<P class="p96 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I’m always more than happy to share information on key projects and if the Councillor believes that would best be accomplished by a Council seminar, which we have had in the past, I can assure you of that because I know was there and maybe three or four other Councillors. A lot of Councillors didn’t show up. There is much more on the table today so no, I would have no problem with that.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Fielding?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>I guess the question has kind of been asked, but it’s new information that I had about this…about the BRT, the piece about the rail line. Is there any estimated cost? I mean, obviously you want to make sure the information is out there, but what exactly is the cost that you guys are working off now for BRT? I know in your press release, 620 some odd million, somewhere around that mark. So what do you anticipate with the…you know…I guess those dollars plus this added cost for the whole project to come in at?</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p97 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I thank Councillor Fielding for that. The numbers that we were looking at and made public I believe was 600 million. Just recently there was an announcement with the Provincial Government where they had agreed to go half, which would be 225 so it’s basically…I’m going by memory…225, 225 and 150. Those are the numbers that I do recall from the administration from the briefings, and if you recall there was a time where the Provincial Government said they would only do <NOBR>one-third</NOBR> but they have had a change of heart and they have confirmed that they would go to the 225.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Mr. Mayor, some time ago I’d asked you about the relocation of rail lines, or moving rail lines closer to homes to accommodate the rapid transit corridor and you answered at that time that you would not support the movement of rail lines closer to homes to accommodate the rapid transit corridor. In the presentation put forward in public, in parts of the St. Norbert Ward, the rail lines are being relocated significantly closer to existing housing and if memory serves me correctly, they are actually contrary to the standards that were put forth, the recommendations put forth by FCM for railroad development. Can you tell me Mr. Mayor if you still agree that the rail lines should not be moved closer to homes to accommodate the rapid transit corridor?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I believe this is very similar to a question that Councillor Swandel asked last month regarding the situation, and we do know that the administration did come and say that in a certain specific area, that it was going to be moved, and I think that’s why Councillor Wyatt made a very good suggestion having a Council seminar so we could share that with everybody so we know exactly what it is, so that all the facts are on the table. And if there are other options available, those can be discussed as well.</P>
<P class="p94 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p44 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>That was not my question. My question was, and I’ll be very clear. In the St. Norbert part, the part to the south of Bishop Grandin, not the part that we talked about a month ago, there are homes along the railroad track that currently exist. The current alignment calls for the railroad to be moved closer to those homes to create enough space for the rapid transit corridor. Previously, not last month but many months ago, I’d asked the Mayor if he would go with me and say that you can’t move things closer to homes and at that time the Mayor said he would not support moving the railroad closer to homes. Has he changed his position?</P>
<P class="p22 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I very clearly heard the question the first time, and my answer will the same okay. I will look at all the information and all the data, look at all the other options and what is out there, and then make a final decision.</P>
<P class="p33 ft1">Madam Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I’d like to know if the Mayor will stand by what he said in Hansard when I previously asked the question. This not the answer to that question, but the previous answer was very directly “no”. Will you stand by that answer?</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker for the record, I can’t recall a time where I’ve never stood by what I said. By the same token I can’t recall a time where I haven’t said I want to see all the information, explore all the options and make the most astute decision possible and keep something in mind Madam Speaker, Council will make the final decision. Not Councillor Swandel, not Mayor Katz.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further questions for the Mayor? Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p44 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>One final question on the rapid transit piece. I’ve been pretty open, obviously. I believe that we should be focusing on roads first. Is there a stepping off point where you’d say this is getting too expensive? I mean, this is 600, 700, 800 million dollars of money that could go to fix the roads. So just knowing the fact that we have some new information on the table, that this could cost millions more than 600 and some odd million dollars that’s already potentially allocated for this, is there a stepping off point where you say, this project is $800 million? There’s no way that we can do this.</P>
<P class="p98 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Madam Speaker that would not be an accurate statement. To start off with, is that throwing numbers out is not very astute. The number we’ve been working with is $600 million. Only $225 million of that would be City of Winnipeg money. The rest would be coming from the other two levels of government. No one can decide what they’re going to do with their money. They’ve committed monies. One level of government has committed $225 million to rapid transit, another one through P3 may commit $150 million, so let’s talk about the numbers that are real and as I say, you cannot automatically assume and I think it would be very foolish to believe that the Provincial Government would just,</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p18 ft1">March 26, 2014</P>
<P class="p53 ft4">like that, take that $225 million and just go and do something else because this is what they said they’re prepared to do specifically, so I think if we’re going to talk numbers, let’s talk real numbers and let’s also be cognizant of the fact this is other levels of government. We can only talk about the money we are investing which is $225 million. The other scenario Madam Speaker, if you look at some of the applications that are coming into P3 from other cities, okay, rapid transit is certainly high on the list, and if we want to compete with other cities, whether it’s Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, Montreal, etc., I mean rapid transit is something that every major city should have. By the same token you also have to make sure that you can afford it.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>I guess it will be an “are you aware”. Are you aware that there is only one taxpayer out there, whether it’s, you know, we talk about our contribution, the $225 million. At the end of the day, this is 600, 700, 800 million dollars of cold hard liquid cash from all the levels of government to go towards infrastructure. We talk all the time about the horrible shape the roads are in…</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Your question Councillor.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>The question is, are you aware that $600 million could invest in substantial amounts of road work and are you aware of a number that you would say, this is crazy. We’ve got to stop this. We’ve got to invest the money. So I ask the question again.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I don’t mind the preamble Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, it’s interesting how other cities are spending billions…I’ll repeat…billions of dollars on rapid transit and once again, the City’s commitment to date is in the neighbourhood of $225 million. That’s all that’s out there. That’s the only money that we can talk about. The other money is not available for other projects. In the end, Council will decide whether they want to proceed or not. I’m very cognizant of the fact that Councillor Fielding, and it’s his right, has never, ever been supportive of that. I respect that. I get it. That’s his prerogative and I appreciate him speaking his mind, but in the end, we live in a democratic society and Council will make the final decision.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Mayes. </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. I hadn’t planned on asking a question but I’d just like the Mayor to clarify that there’s talk there of 600 million and a lot of discussion. Councillor Fielding has been consistent; he’s not a supporter of the extension. I think I’ve been consistent. I am a supporter of the extension. One of the things I ran on. But the 600 million isn’t just rapid transit and I’m wondering if the Mayor could clarify. There was talk there about this is money that could go to hard infrastructure, roads, bridges, sewers. Part of the 600 million, my understanding is, is going to combined sewer, parts going to “the road” which is Pembina and “the bridge” which is over top. If we did this work in sequence it would cost more. It’s being bundled together, but I wonder if the Mayor could clarify just that the 600 million is not simply limited to the BRT aspect of this project.</P>
<P class="p99 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you. Through you to Councillor Mayes, I repeated over and over again…I think everybody knows the answer. It is definitely not. A significant amount of the money goes to the underpass at Jubilee which will also include active transportation. A significant amount of money goes to the Calrossie for drainage for where we have significant neighbourhoods that are flooding and the balance goes to rapid transit, so I hope that’s as clear as I can make it and I thank the Councillor for asking that question.</P>
<P class="p94 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Anything further? Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p44 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Just in an preamble, we’ve been dealing with a number of situations where we talk about budget <NOBR>over-runs</NOBR> on capital projects and, you know, discussions about what is the set budget and today we’re talking about the City’s commitment to $225 million of the project, but I think, you know, I’d like to ask the Mayor a question because right now we don’t have the kind of estimates we need to actually vote on an actual budget, so could the Mayor please clarify as to whether or not the $225 million is the budget Council voted on or is that just the initial commitment that the City has looked at in their capital plan?</P>
<P class="p23 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>That is the commitment that we have looked at. That is the number we have worked with. That is the number we went to the Provincial and Federal Governments with, so those are the working numbers and as we know, and Councillor Eadie you’re right, working numbers can change. They can go up, they can go down. There’s no question about that.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question Councillor Eadie?</P>

<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker, and through you to the Mayor, just so again to clarify so that the public doesn’t come back at us some time way in the future, that the 225 million is not the actual budget for the City’s portion of the rapid transit extension, southwest rapid transit extension.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>That money is not just for the rapid transit. It’s for three different scenarios: Calrossie drainage, Jubilee and the rapid transit. In addition to that, that is the number that we budgeted for the 600. It’s 225 City, 225 Province and 150 P3 Canada. Those are the working numbers.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Well, before he tells me, the Mayor will tell me that I have contacted the auditor and I understand that the real estate audit will be coming to Council for our May Council meeting. Is that the Mayor’s understanding that it will end up, in fact, be at Council in May?</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>That is definitely my understanding and I would be extremely disappointed if it’s anything other than that.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Will the Mayor ensure that all staff mentioned in the audit are available to Council to discuss the report?</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>I’d love to give the Councillor the opportunity to clarify exactly what she means by that.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Okay. When the fire hall / fire paramedic review report was provided, one of the main people identified in the report was not available to Council to ask questions to. Do we anticipate, or can the Mayor assure us, that there will be no key parties who are mentioned in the report who will leave the organization prior to and if they do so, can they come back and speak with Council and answer our questions about this report?</P>
<P class="p92 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Based on that clarification, I’ll make it very clear Madam Speaker and I think Councillor Havixbeck knows the answer. That was not the Mayor’s doing in any way, shape or form. I think she knows exactly why that took place. The other scenario is it would be desirous if anyone, whether it’s a Councillor or a staff, would be available. End of story.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. And that ends question period. Moving onto the Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works. Councillor Swandel on a report dated March 13th, 2014.</P>

<P class="p36 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you. I stood it down Madam Speaker only because, you know, I want to draw the attention to the graph on page 14, which is missed garbage collection in 2013, deficiencies per 10,000 homes per week. So it's a ratio system they have here and I just want to point out the fact that we have two companies in the City of Winnipeg right now, one is Emterra, one is BFI, providing our garbage collection system and as it can be demonstrated with this graph quite clearly that the missed garbage collection, the rate of garbage collection being impacted per 10,000 almost a week</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p18 ft1">March 26, 2014</P>
<P class="p19 ft15">is a lot higher with Emterra on a ratio basis than it is with BFI. We have a real issue here, Madam Speaker, that I don't think is going to go away. We're going to need to address it. I’ve you know met with members of the industry and it really concerns me to what I’m hearing with regards to the operation in terms of Emterra, with regards to the quality of their vehicles. And by the way, I don’t think any other member of Council may be aware of some of these things including the Chair of this. You know, I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that there’s some real issues here. The trucks that they have in question that they’re using for the City are vehicles that clearly were…they were actually originally ear marked for and designed for the lower mainland of Vancouver and not Winnipeg climate and Winnipeg weather. There’s a challenge with regards to the maintenance of the vehicles. Last summer, Madam Speaker, they had approximately more than a dozen vehicles pulled over at Brady Landfill and the Provincial Highways Department basically pulled them off the road for lack of maintenance. These are vehicles, Madam Speaker, that this is was last summer who were brand new in November and are not…and then all of a sudden, we’ve seen a spike in the summer and we were told it was because of staff shortages or what not. But what I’ve heard through the industries, there’s some serious issues in terms of vehicle maintenance and their operation. I think the Public Service needs to takes a serious look at this company and exactly what we're into here with regards to this contract because I don't want to wake up one day and find out that this company is almost starting rolling up there and packing it in because they’re not making any money or they can't make it work anymore. It’s something which…clearly there’s an issue here with them and it seems to be continuous. I can appreciate if at the start of a contract, they have a number of issues to work through with regards to, you know, garbage collection, but this is now…they seem to continually have issues going right through and you know, Madam Speaker, I think we need to take a second look at it. So I stood this report down not because…the report is fine, I’m supporting the report, I’m just…it was an opportunity to speak to this issue. It’s something that concerns me and all of us in terms of I think, you know, the <NOBR>pick-up</NOBR> with regards to garbage and the concern we have with regards to the operation of that company, specifically when we can see, clearly, that one company can provide the service in a way, the same level, the same type of service in one neighbourhood of the City at a far higher level of customer service than the other company. And that tells me that there’s something going on with that company that needs to be addressed clearly, right now. I just want to add that you know at one time, our city, years ago, before, actually before 1998, we made a point of encouraging local entrepreneurs, encouraging local business people…How? We divided the contract throughout the city. We basically created quadrants if you like, of the city, which are allowed local companies to bid. Administratively, maybe it was more cumbersome for our managers to handle because they’re dealing with multiple providers, multiple contracts, but it ensured for competition, ensured for local business. After post 98, Council moved away from that creating these large single contracts, in this case two, throughout the city. So you know I think we might want to contemplate going back in the future to, back to the future to that scenario because of the fact that it gives us greater flexibility, maybe not quadrants, maybe three contracts, <NOBR>city-wide</NOBR> one on the east, one on the south, one on the north, but some scenario where we basically can assure that we will not be in a position to be held ransom by any private company. I’m not saying that will happen, but just that it doesn’t… we’re not in a weak position, that we can provide the garbage service to the citizens of Winnipeg as they expect and that we would not be in any kind of position because one company has such a large share of the City's garbage collection service right now. So those are just some thoughts and I’ll be supporting the report. I thank the Chair of the committee for allowing me to speak to and yourself, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p102 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Havixbeck followed by Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Overall, I think that the important thing to not lose sight of is the amount that we are now diverting from the landfill. That is key. Fifty five percent more since implementation and I think that that's an important milestone for our City. It’s helped us catch up, perhaps even surpass some municipalities. So that’s a really good thing. I too have a few concerns and perhaps the Chair in his closing comment might speak to those. There are still no fees and he can correct me if I’m wrong, but there are still no fees and fines listed that I could find that are, have been imposed for missed or late pickups. On page 12 of the report, we cite that the single family dwellings of garbage total 8.5 and 5.5 for recycling. This is less from 9.3 and 6.2 respectively and that…those numbers do not necessarily say whether missed fees and fines, missed <NOBR>pick-ups</NOBR> late fees and fines are included in that. And you know, I, too, echo Councillor Wyatt's concerns about the missed and late pickups. In fact, when we went back over the call log in my office, the calls, the number one reason people call our office is because they’ve gone through 311 maybe a few times and they can't the responses and…or the service to pick up and so I still think that that’s a concern on a day to day basis. The other pieces in this report on organics, I understand consultation is ongoing right now, the cost of $200,000, many people city wide already do compost and use their kitchen organics and house hold organics and that. And I’m hoping that the consultation will address that because I hear from a lot of people that they will be very unhappy if they have to pay a fee, for example, to have compost or household organics picked up when they’re already doing something productive with it and putting it back into the earth. So I hope that that consultation is going to address some of that. I simply wanted to point out those couple of deficiencies, but I will be supporting the report. It’s a piece for information and overall I think it is a good news piece for our City. Thank you.</P>

But the first aspect though is the one that really affects the Mynarski City Councillor’s office and that is the deficiencies and missed collection. And while certain areas within my ward get really good pick up, other areas are very, very, very inconsistent and yes, there was a problem this winter with…Again, we had an extraordinary winter thing happening, but in terms of the deficiencies, it's good that the numbers are there because what they’re saying here, I believe in this chart, is that those are the actual deficiencies and if they are, there is a possibility to calculate what the fines should be, but I would, in my debate or discussion about this report, I’d like to let you know that the Ombudsman’s office concurred with Emterra's insistence that it would affect their competitive position within North America, actually and you know, the only way I can surmise that that would do it is if they are in negotiations with other cities and people start to understand the deficient…like, why are we living with this level of missed collection? Like, come on, seriously, what is the best…like, maybe one percent, like what is the expectation of service provision, like, really. You know, service…like, I look at many businesses and different industries and different sectors. You know, nobody would tolerate a service that actually had that level of misses, of lack of service. It’s crazy. So you know, I’ll leave it at that, in terms of the deficiency. But we don’t know, and I did ask the Mayor a question about, you know, the position of getting information. I question whether Emterra is sustainable at this point. I don’t see how they can continue on five year contract if they continue to face this kind of level of problems and you know I think there’s actually a pressure on the City, itself. I mean who would be willing to move in right away, with a number of trucks if this business fell apart. Like, I don’t know, maybe they’re making extra money in other cities and bringing it in here, but you know, if you look at all those deficiencies, how in the world are they operating when their fines, that kind of level of fines that should be charged based on that deficiency? How are they operating today? So Councillor Wyatt is correct. I have to agree with him, like you know, it's very difficult. The overall report, it’s great. The amount of diversion is really great, but you know, I recently moved into a fourplex and I always assumed that you know…we assumed that all of our population is quite educated in how to, what is recyclable, what isn't. You know, how much garbage in, it's amazing that in a four unit place, I think only two out of the four, so 50 percent of the household knows what to recycle and is…is doing recycling, but I’m finding that my garbage cart is filling up with my neighbour's garbage because they’re producing so much garbage. I know in those bags there’s got to be a lot of recycling. I know that in certain neighbourhoods within my ward, William Whyte specifically are doing a lot of education with people trying to help them understand how to utilize the cart system because I think some of that problem is why, you know, you might have missed garbage collection or whatever because people don't even understand you’re not allowed to have your cart to be overflowing and you know there’s still a lot of education happening there. So I think that that diversion rate is great. But as…and I hope that our Solid Waste Department as well as our different Residents’ Associations as we educate people more and more about how to use our actual new cart system that things will improve. But…and so like I will…it is a report to accept it as information. I think it's great and I would also reflect that yeah, there are a number of people who do utilize their organics so forcing them to pay a fee if they’re already dealing with it I think is a real issue. And it’s actually my only regret though, to have one where I live, I can't set up a composter, so my kitchen scraps sadly are going into the waste, into the garbage cycle, but anyway, I’ll leave it at that. I’ll support the information, but really, I really don't understand how…actually, I don’t understand the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce could’ve given an award to a company that looks like it's not sustainable. Thank you very much.</P>
<P class="p102 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>I would like to quickly say that the service is horrible. It has been. It is…there’s absolutely no reason why this service should be so poor. They’ve had more than enough time to know where the route systems are. I know it's happening constantly, and in my area, I don't know if it's getting better or worse. So that's one side. The other one, of course, I’ll take the report as information and when I remove out the…we talk about how great the diversion rates are and they are nice, but I’m still having some questions about if you pulled out the leaf program, how much we’re actually be…how much value we are getting. The leaf program is a huge percentage of this diversion, which is fantastic, but that’s a separate program almost all by itself. So I’m not convinced that they’re providing the service that we need. I know not providing the service that Winnipeggers deserve. I’m not sure if we’re really achieving the results. I hope we would with this investment. I see broken carts all around our back lane. I don't see any of the arms coming up to if you every want to save our staff, all that break, the back breaking work because we have all these automated systems. I have never seen one of those trucks. I know when those trucks to down some of the old neighbourhoods. We’ve actually having unfortunate reality of that, some of the lines from Shaw cable and other cables are too low, so we’ve had to plow backlanes to the cement all winter on some backlanes because their trucks are too big. That’s not our problem, that’s their problem, but our residents are taking it with these huge windrows they had to deal with all winter because their trucks are too high. Again, that is part of their service delivery and their lack thereof. So I know we’re in a contract right now. I will keep on this file and with Council, but I just wanted to express for the record that I feel that the service has let Winnipeggers down and Council.</P>

<P class="p77 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, I just want to add that despite all these problems you’re mentioning, I’ve never seen our city so clean. Back lanes, I drive through the North End. I drive through Elmwood and all the back lanes are totally different than they were just a few years ago. I just want to add that. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Swandel to close.</P>
<P class="p36 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to thank Councillor Steen for making that comment because the greatest impact that we have is not the problems we’re having with the service. The greatest impact we have is how much better our city looks and that’s why we started down this path. Waste diversion, yard waste used to go to the landfill, so it is a significant part of our diversion now and it has to be included. We all are aware too that there’s the whole composting program, the resale of the material, which is an important part of this. I want to respond to some of the comments that were made. The comparison to BFI is really not a fair comparison. If you were to take the first year's data for BFI, and remember this is the first year’s data for Emterra. So if you were to take the first year’s data for BFI and I think Councillor Fielding and Councillor Nordman could probably attest to this, you would see quite a balancing in there. With regard to Councillor Eadie's comment that perhaps one percent would be an appropriate level of deficiency. I don’t agree, I think it should be lower. And I think it should be lower than what it is in this report because this report, it's at high of .5 percent and the average is .225 percent. To put it in perspective, what we’re talking about here are deficiencies running in the per week, 40 homes for 10,000 collections, 40 deficiencies for 10,000 collections. There…you know, the complaints come, yes, and they’re loud and there’s been growing pains here and nobody could argue with that. We do operate it under a contract and there are processes that we take care of. Any information we can provide to Councillors that…is legitimate to do and you know considering the fact that we’re in a contract with a private party here we do that. You know, so…you know, this report overall is good. You know, I think that the service levels will improve and next year when we get the report, we’ll be able to do the comparison of what it did and what improvements did we make and where we see other improvements that have some recommendations coming forward as well. Someone made an announcement and commented about the lines in the back lanes. I think maybe it was Council Orlikow. I would agree that it is their problem, but that’s the only if the lines are installed according to the standards they are supposed to be installed. If they’re not then, they’re either our problem or the utilities problem who’ve actually, incorrectly installed them and I believe the equipment was inspected based on a standard for lines. So you know let's be careful of you, know, trying to…trying to throw the negatives out when we have such a positive report here. We will improve. This will get better. Our city is looking better. Our efforts towards the sustainability in the city are driving the right direction as a result of this contract. So overall this is a very positive report for the City of Winnipeg. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p103 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. All those in favour of Item 2? Contrary? Carried. Now, we have three other committee reports to get through.

<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. First of all, the implementation by Emterra of the current garbage collection system started in the Mynarski Ward and in the west end and wherever there were autobins, started much earlier than the rest of the contract for the whole city, and my question really is, would you agree that the first half of the year of Emterra’s performance, first half year, was actually started August 1, 2012 to December 31. Would the Chairperson agree with that?</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>I would take the Councillor's word on that.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you very much, and pardon me for not reading the graph appropriately and that sort of thing, but I’m sorry I missed the percentage but…so is it correct that the Chairperson is saying that a zero miss tolerance is what we should expect?</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>It's not correct that I said that, no.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Anything further Councillor Eadie?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>As I agree, no misses are good so the Chairperson is saying that to have as little misses as possible, is that correct?</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>I’m not sure whether I’m in an Abbott and Costello skit here or not, but obviously we’d all want there to be zero misses if possible. We know that’s not possible. There’s going to be times when equipment breaks down or weather happens. We strive to get as best we can in every level of service that we provide in the City of Winnipeg.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p105 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Chair, or Madam Speaker. My question through you to the Chair of the standing policy committee is, the City has implemented a “Know Your Zone” program for the plowing of residential streets. Last week we initiated a program where we didn't implement parking tags, parking fees but we still initiated a zone program where people were expecting to have their streets plowed for drainage issues at specified <NOBR>twelve-hour</NOBR> intervals. In my ward, nothing north of Chief Peguis trail…okay very, very few streets north of Chief Peguis were actually plowed at all before the program terminated on Friday and those streets that were plowed, a large percentage of them were not done during the <NOBR>twelve-hour</NOBR> window. In fact, over this past winter, from my own personal experience at my home, two of three residential plows were not done during the <NOBR>twelve-hour</NOBR> “Know your Zone” program. Are we looking at ways to improve this program or are we looking at scrapping it and perhaps coming up with something different?</P>
<P class="p106 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you Councillor, through you Madam Speaker. We are always looking at ways to improve the program. I know the administration is sort of going to be going through a debriefing at the end of this season to see what some of the problems are that arose out of the “Know Your Zone” program, the timing, the amount of snow, the temperatures that we were dealing with. We may have to find ways to create more flexibility in there. Previous years though, we used to just give three days to go through the areas. The contractor used to do it and there was no zone. I remind you that it was Council's decision to go to “Know Your Zone” because the complaints that were coming in were about having to take your cars off of the street for three days. Why do we have to take our cars off the street if our streets aren’t being plowed? Or if they’re not going to come and plow it that night, if they’re not going to do it for two days, why have to (inaudible), so we tried to improve the system by doing it, and as a result of that, we found that, in a bizarre weather year, that we have these serious hiccups that occur. Just with regard to the end of the year, and it’s probably… I’ll get the director to send some information out on this, the sort of doing some street clearing to open up the drainage basins, the catch basins, then the land drainage system and get the back lanes prepared for that, I think we ran into some weather there that didn’t make that the right thing to do. I would have to get a little bit more detail from the director and see what we’re going to be doing in the weeks ahead because I know, some of the back lanes, I know I was in Councillor Orlikow’s ward the other day. It’s rock hard ice because of the freeze and thaw, and you know, the other thing that we get is if we do start pushing that, we pile those great big windrows of ice up, we’re going to have the other side of the argument happening, and we don’t have storage capacity left to be moving that around in there, so I think there’s a bit of a balancing act going on here and it's the <NOBR>clean-up</NOBR> for spring <NOBR>run-off</NOBR> that we’re trying to do. It’s not a snow</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Madam Speaker. Through you to the Chair, it would seem that the Water and Waste staff have devised a method to thaw pipes. Does the Chair agree that this is something that could have a direct economic benefit for the City if it were to be patented and perhaps shared with other capital region municipalities?</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>It’s a good question, Madam Speaker. It was actually raised. I want to thank the Councillor for raising it. It was a question I asked the director at the Council seminar in terms of the fact that they have come up with this newer system. I’m not too sure if a patent can be done or not. The director wasn’t sure at the time, but I would have to take the question under advisement and then forward that information back to her.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Second question?</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Does the Chair agree that we are now in a period of climate change and perhaps it might be time to create a municipal climate change reserve and begin lobbying other levels of government as we go forward on that?</P>
<P class="p108 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that climate change, if you agree with the majority of the scientists which are analyzing this, which I do, is happening. It's taking place and it’s something which is a real concern in terms of the overall impact on our city. You know, if we have more of these extreme situations, whether it be cold winter events or large amounts of precipitation, whether it be in the form of snow or rain, clearly this is going to have an impact on our ability to deliver services. So I would welcome the suggestion and maybe something that the Councillor who is a member of the Finance Committee, the standing committees exist, they’re called Standing Policy Committees. They exist to allow for policy discussion and debate and to allow for policy work to take place in the development of policy, and as the Councillor knows our committee, even though we have our fixed agenda, we're always open to her ideas and suggestions on the committee’s floor, so you know, that’s something which we would…I'm sure we could have a very good discussion on. I can tell you that, you know, Winnipeg is strategically located in the centre of the continent. We are lucky in many regards in the fact that we are not on an ocean, we’re not on a major <NOBR>ocean-way</NOBR> which could potentially see a rise in sea level which is a real concern in coming years, but the other challenge we’re having is a lot of the <NOBR>mid-continent</NOBR> weather patterns are changing and we are seeing the extremes, so the question will be whether or not we have to change our standards in terms of construction, in terms of what we build based on that and that’s something that we should be looking at. I know that there is the new Building Canada program which is available which is coming out shortly and, you know, they are taking into consideration different environmental issues as well as part of that program, so it might be an opportunity. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p44 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I speak to this one more as a ward Councillor than as Chair of the Property Committee. This is just a bad planning exercise. It’s proposed a large apartment retail centre that’s been proposed in the RM of East St. Paul. I don't have an issue with the development per se, the issue is in terms of planning, the only road access is to this will be off of residential streets at this point. Until such time has…they can demonstrate an appropriate traffic management plan is there, this is what we are proposing to prevent this from being a traffic nightmare in the North Kildonan.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Okay, thank you. Any…Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I really didn't stand this down just to give the area Councillor a chance to speak to it. I wanted to bring this up because it's not just in this part of the city that we’re starting to see the neighbouring municipalities under development having an impact on the City of Winnipeg. I know Councillor Wyatt has had significant goings on with some of the industrial development around Transcona as well. I don’t know that’s all one municipality or not. But I know, this is…this is very difficult to deal with. When we saw the way that the traffic would have to run the service, such a large scale development, it was…it was scary. And, you know, you talk about in our processes, we have…we use the terminology of substantial adverse effect when we’re dealing with variances and conditional uses and you know, you think about you know these lighter streets having the type of traffic that you would see going to a, you know, a large shopping centre coming down them. That's pretty scary, but it's not just in this area that it’s happening. And I think we as a City and certainly Councillor Browaty as the Chair of Property and Development have to start considering what the boundaries of this city are. We look at what we have for our land supply and we look at you know when you get to the attractive development areas, you know, there’s some in the north, some in the south and little bits left. I don’t know how much there is in the east, there’s some real servicing challenges, the cost of servicing some lands and some areas. We…we, I’m going to use the word, we should probably be talking about annexation or growing the City's boundaries. I know that this particular issue is going to the Municipal Board and I won’t get into any details on that because that’s….it’s a very specific process, a very specific ask. But I also know that the Municipal Board is the avenue that we would go down to if we were to say we need to be the planning authority on these lands. You know, there’s some places where inside the perimeter is a logical boundary. This is one of those areas. I think both Dan and Russ must have them on the east side of the city. I have them as you go to the west of Waverley, Waverley West and West St. Paul has pieces inside the city. So throughout the city, you know, if you just consider the perimeter a natural boundary, there’s certainly, there’s a lot of areas that we should be looking at because the access into them is coming out of our city neighbourhoods. And you know, we’re willing to work with our partners and municipal regions, we’ve shown that. When you get, you know, this type of planning challenge is, is telling you that there is something wrong and you know, I don’t know where to go with this. I…you know, this one is easy to say specific to this, but perhaps, what I really want out of the Chair is some commentary on his thoughts on having the administration look aT what would be appropriate for drawing the City of Winnipeg, where the line should be. I mean, it’s easy to identify this one, but to maybe bring together a report and look at what where we have servicing capacity, that’s easy to go out, that makes more sense when you look through that sustainability lens. That’s where we should be going because on the residential side, the lands we have are getting short. Employment lands, you know, we're getting down. We're getting thin. So we really need to take a serious look at this and that was really my reason to stand this down because when I heard this, “we're going to go the Municipal Board to challenge what you’ve done”. I think we’ve got to say something back. We want to be respectful when we do that, but you know if you’re going to create these problems for the citizens</P>

<P class="p65 ft2">of the City of Winnipeg, then maybe we should be the planners of those lands. So I’ll leave it at that. I think you know I’m generalizing here, but I’m pretty sure that the Chair gets the gist of what I am trying to say and the importance of it and perhaps we can just get some commentary back before we move this forward.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I don't want to say much, but you know I think that the councillor in this particular situation is responded in an appropriate fashion along with the City of Winnipeg and of course I’ll be supporting this motion. And the whole issue, yes, of planning and, you know, we did attend a capital region seminar and, you know, some of the future looks good that there are people trying to bring together appropriate planning in areas. But, you know, that process has taken a long time. Councillor Nordman has been a champion of trying to get that co- operation. But, you know, at some point, yes, we do and if we can take over all the planning for anything within the perimeter at least, I think that would be an appropriate issue. But I would also point out though that in response to a number of problems that we’ve seen from the City of Winnipeg and other municipalities around the capital region, I will point out that there was a motion that was defeated by Councillor Wyatt and Councillor Eadie to move towards taking over all the lands within the Perimeter Highway, to expedite the City’s ability to do the planning in those terms and it sounds like there may be a need to do that kind of thing. So maybe in the future, in the <NOBR>short-term</NOBR> future, we’ll hear a motion to move ahead on that kind of thing. So anyway, I will be supporting this particular move to block that until a proper traffic plan is provided by the developer of a major retail outlet. I spent a lot of time knocking on doors in that neighbourhood and I think it would be a really awful thing for that kind of traffic that it would draw coming through there and disturbing residents. Thanks.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Yeah, I want to thank Councillor Browaty for taking the action he’s taking on this. I was at the public hearing where we listened to the different delegations and one of the delegations was the attorney for the developer who basically, in no uncertain words, legally threatened the City with legal action if we were to go down these roads, this road and one of the questions posed to the attorney in the Q and A after was, well, we fully expect you to also take legal action against the Provincial Government who has prevented you from hooking up to their highway, the Perimeter Highway and of course the response is, well we have no intention at this point to take legal action against the Provincial Government. And it was a moot point, but the point is this, you know, we live in a world where we have limited resources in terms of and challenges in terms of fixing our existing infrastructure. We have limited resources in terms of building new strategic infrastructure, and yet we have a capital region which is growing, and a capital region which is putting pressure on our municipal services and they’re coming and saying, well, we want to tap into your municipal services to allow for our growth and the challenge here is really one of okay, well, the capital region is growing, we're growing and yet, none of the new strategic infrastructure, which is necessary, for example, at that location, the interchange at Lagimodiere and the Perimeter Highway, we’ve been waiting almost 20 years for that to be built. There’s been deaths occurring, well known death at that intersection. It's dangerous and the Provincial Government is taking their time and not and as identified many other great separation that are going to be done prior to this one, which was identified years ago, promised years ago and then never delivered. And you know, there’s an opportunity probably to address a lot of the challenges in terms of this property with that development. Having said that it is true, Councillor Eadie is absolutely 100 percent correct. We authored a motion to extend the boundaries of the city to the Perimeter Highway, which ironically I think a lot of Winnipeggers probably think that’s where the city begins in their mind, is the Perimeter Highway. Well, it doesn’t actually. It’s beyond in some…in some cases, you know, we go beyond the Perimeter Highway and maybe we can trade them that section. Of course, then we’d have to get rid of St. Norbert, but that would be, you know, but whatever the cecession will be so, but you know, but anyway, no, you know, all joking aside, it's a real problem. I mean we had a…in terms of…this is a challenge in terms of a large regional retail operation that wants to locate right up against a residential area without proper arterial roads to service it. At point, the other point that was made at the public hearing was that clearly there was maybe not a lot of thought given in terms of the planning in the municipality only because just a year or two before, they approved a whole residential subdivision up against Henderson Highway which could’ve been the site for their regional retail against Henderson Highway and the residential coming off of Raleigh/ Gateway in behind, but that was not the way, the municipality approve development so it was clearly a long term thinking that was going on, that should’ve been going on. And it's now very unfortunate to see them filing an application in this ward to challenge this. I can say this will not go away, this will just continue. In terms of my ward, Council Swandel is 100 percent correct. The issue there on the boundary surrounded by the RM of Springfield on all sides and the Province in their wisdom has allowed for more and more industrial development with substandard services. And when I say substandard services, I mean, substandard services based on what we require for services. We have a massive industrial development that has no water, that has basically a rudimental service system that has no fire hydranst, that has no full time fire department. And I’ll tell you, it is a ticking time bomb, I’ve said on the floor before and I will say it again. It's a matter of time before a disaster occurs and there’s been fires there before, in the last number of years, a disaster occurs where there will be an evacuation of citizens of Winnipeg because of the toxic nature of that, of</P>

<P class="p115 ft6">what they’re doing up there in terms of all the different industries they have. It's just not acceptable to have that type of development, heavy industrial development without the kind of level of services that would be automatic inside the City of Winnipeg and ironically when it comes to possibly being able to compete with them in terms of marketing and employment lands, they’re out competing us. Well, that's not a surprise when they can discount the land because of the fact that they’re not required to have a level of services that are expected inside the city. So this is a real issue, the Province has turned blind eye, I mean it goes back to when the government was first elected in 1999 and they set up the Thomas Report, the Paul Thomas Report, and that report made a number of recommendations in terms of the capital region, and it was just too hard to take those recommendations and implement them politically. The government chose to take the report and stick it on a shelf and that's where it's been ever since and that's unfortunate, Madam Speaker, because you know there are so many good things happening inside of the City with growth and development. And there’s so many good things happening in terms of the capital region. Why we can't work together and find solutions, maybe it's time for regional government again in this city. We had it before. It was called Metro, maybe it’s…it works in the United States, all over the United States, just south of us, regional governments to work together to find solutions in terms of service delivery. We have pressures in terms of transit. We…I had a resident one time phone me. I thought she was a resident of Transcona complaining about the fact she cannot get a park and ride spot beside Kildonan Place Shopping Centre. I determined then determined that actually she is not a resident of Transcona. She is a resident of East St. Paul. I suggested she call her Reeve and set up their own park and ride. I mean, but the pressures are there. We saw the change in policy we did as a city in terms of offering, just recently, offering swim programs in terms of our pool saying that residents of Winnipeg will have a first right of refusal, the first chance. And residents outside the city were furious. What about our kids? Well, they should. Well, you know what, they have a point, a child is a child. We live in Canada. Every child in my view should not only read and write, but also know how to swim in this country when you’ve got a hundred thousand lakes in this province and you’ve got lakes and rivers across this country, it's not a privilege, it’s a life skill. And so, why aren’t we working together to address these challenges as a capital region we should be. So I want to thank Councillor Nordman as well for the work he’s doing and trying to bring people together. I think there could be some solutions in the future, but you know, annexation is one of them, but you know what, if…let's see if…what we can do to work together and if it does not work, then annexation probably will be the solution unfortunately. In the meantime, I would encourage the RM of East St. Paul to rethink their approach; rethink their attitude towards the City of Winnipeg in terms of…you know, take it or leave it and rolling the dice going to the Municipal Board because they will have a war on their hands, a war on their hands between the citizens of North Kildonan and the citizens of East St. Paul. Most of them know each other. Most of them are friends or family, but they will have a war on their hands, guaranteed if they continue down this path and go to the Municipal Board. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</P>
<P class="p102 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Steen.</P>
<P class="p35 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>I’d just, Madam Speaker, I’d just like to add that the intersections on Raleigh and Gateway are probably some of the most terrible we have in the city. If you’ve driven them, they’re pretty dangerous now and full of traffic and I don't think they can handle any more traffic coming from a big development out on the east side and that…that was my reasoning. I was at the same meeting, and that's why I support closing those streets until the streets are dealt with. And who is going to pay for that? I don’t know. That’s a lot of money so. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Nordman.</P>
<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Nordman: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I was going to not speak on this, but given the partnership of the Manitoba Capital Region has been addressed here and I’d just like to share with you that and thank Councillor Wyatt for recognizing the fact that we are trying to build some bridges. And we…for many of us, attended the Council seminar with the capital region, building something big program and I think within that the four pillars that…that program is built on is regional planning and regional thinking is…and not necessarily another level of governance, but certainly regional thinking is popping up all across North America as Councillor Wyatt said in Edmonton, Calgary, Victoria, Vancouver, they are various degrees of regional <NOBR>co-operation</NOBR> going on with the hub which is in this case, Winnipeg and now the surrounding communities which there are 15 of them. We have just added broken head to the capital region mix, so it's a work in progress, but I think as I shared with the Council seminar, what evolved from being the mayors and reeves of the capital region to, back in about 1997 I think, to what is now known as the partnership of the capital region in 2006 and beyond, we’re sort of at the end of the beginning of this process and whether or not, it would ever move to a full Metro type of organization as Councillor Wyatt suggests. I have my doubts, but at this point, we are looking to share services and corporate on things like the environment, about regional planning. The master transportation plan for the partnership of the Capital Region has just been released. And it talks about the traffic corridors that will be required over the next 30 years. To service the City of Winnipeg and the last piece which you are all aware of is economic development and tourism which fundamentally is important in the sense that…would as a Councillor for the City of Winnipeg and the ward of St. Charles, would I like to have all economic development happen within the Perimeter Highway, within the city boundaries, absolutely. But I’d much rather a project go to Springfield or St. Andrews or Richot or Tache, rather than see it go to Saskatoon. You know, so you know, the business will stay here in the community of Winnipeg and the RMs will</P>

<P class="p19 ft4">have the opportunity to service that. So going forward, I think you know issues as Councillor Swandel has suggested like this aren’t going to continue to evolve. I’m in a situation on the west side of the city where my ward goes fairly well beyond the Perimeter Highway and which includes the Red River Ex property and the Assiniboia Downs property, the Pointe West Auto Park, and the Chapel Lawn property. So we’ve got a substantial piece of St. Charles Ward in any event that I would not like to trade off for something inside the perimeter. So you know, we’re going to have to have these discussions. I do not use the “a” word and but I think it only creates fear and concern within our organization at the PMCR. So I will encourage everyone to look at situations like the East St. Paul shopping development that is on the dias today and we will examine them on a one by one basis and work cooperatively with our partners in the capital region. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p96 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? I’ll call the question on Item 1. Oh, pardon me, Councillor Browaty to close.</P>
<P class="p95 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’d like to thank Councillor Swandel, Wyatt, Eadie and Steen for your support and Councillor Nordman for your comments. Again, I do think it is time that we probably have that discussion about the borders of the City, and what should be and what should be out, the notion of a Metro government perhaps is something that is also on the table. I mean the elephant in the room is regional thinking is great, but again, capital region cities want to pick up the benefits of being attached to the City of Winnipeg, but not the costs. I mean, you have policing in Winnipeg costs hundreds of millions of dollars. People from the capital region come in and work and do a lot of their activities in the city, but don't contribute necessarily directly towards that. So in my mind that’s the elephant in the room. That said, I mean, they are our neighbours, they are our friends, and I’m…the City’s second rep on the capital region. We’re the only municipality, but rightfully so because we represent vast majority of, we’re the only two, the only group that has two representatives on the partnership for the capital region. And again, what kind of relationship are we going to have? We’ve got a one off deal with West St. Paul in exchange for providing sewage services for example. We have some planning controls. Is that a model? Perhaps, but again, you need to look at the big picture and perhaps looking at the boundaries as well as perhaps the Metro government is something to consider going forward. Again, in this particular instance, this is just, again, if this is all City of Winnipeg, my thinking wouldn't be the same…would be the same in that this isn't an appropriate type of development for the transportation infrastructure that's there today. I’d be remiss if I didn't point out as was kind of mentioned. The Provincial Government, when I was a new cub Councillor back 2006, 2007, I remember going to a Heavy Construction Association breakfast where then Premier Doer spoke. And they had slides up and I got copies of them where they showed their four year, five year plan was to completely over the course of the years, over the five years, build a brand new clover leaf at that intersection. I know there was a open house just a couple of years ago, but still, nothing that I’d seen in terms of material effort to actually build something there. I have mentioned you know last month, I’ve spoken to both the Reeve and to Transportation Minister Ashton. Perhaps there is a way to involve the developer in this case to build a proper you know full blown clover leaf at 59 and Lagimodiere that includes access to a shopping centre there. Actually, one of the things I hear most from my constituents is in the north part of the area, there really aren't a lot of retail amenities. Kildonan Place is a little far. Garden City without Chief Peguis Phase 3 is far. This will be a good amenity for my residents with changes of retail on Henderson Highway. There isn’t a general merchandise retailer. We actually have some reasonable density on Henderson Highway. We have a lot of apartment blocks, a lot of multifamily. But again, if you need, you know, some people, elderly people, they need a panty hose or pair of socks or whatever, there really isn't that type of retailer anymore, whereas 20 years, there were both K Mart and Zellers on Henderson. So again, things are changing and that is a concern for some of the constituents that I represent. So I’m not <NOBR>anti-development</NOBR> and <NOBR>anti-commercial</NOBR> in any way shape or form. So I thank you for everybody for the support and I would appreciate this moving forward. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p53 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I just…I’m voting for seven and eight. There’s a number of concerns, but this is a precinct plan. It’s not the biggest precinct plan, but it’s something that’s going to take about ten years I think as they said that it was going to grow. It’s going to start to grow at McPhillips, just north of where the planned Chief Peguis Trail is going to be coming through. I just…in terms of this precinct plan, there’s already a need for that Chief Peguis Trail as it was actually described by Councillor Browaty, that there’s a lot of traffic that does move through the older streets like Leila and Partridge to get to Garden City Shopping Centre, although I think preference in North Kildonan is to go to Kildonan Place, but there is though, a lot of movement back and forth, much of the needed Chief Peguis Trail extension from Main to McPhillips at least is related to trade in and beyond that actually. It is a really what I would call a trade group to move goods and conduct our commerce, but. In terms of this precinct plan, the new Chief Peguis Trail is actually going to partially take out some forest I believe that is the last bastions of where the deer roam that once roamed along the Red River in the Rivergrove, River…Ridgecrest sort of…Ridgecrest sort of area. Most of that bush and forest is gone. There is some left, and one of the things I wanted to point out that why this is a pretty good precinct plan, again, it’s a smaller one, it’s building where there are where there already is a need for a regional road. And that’s why I’m voting for it, but to point out that they’re actually in this, well, they don't cover the whole forested area in their Precinct F Plan, the North Point Village neighbourhood, it will…they are moving to keep a portion, to keep the forest that's on their particular property as part of that sort of open green space I think as part of their plan to do that in the development of this particular precinct and I think that that's very important. One other important thing to note though is that part of that forest, they don’t go all the way to Ferrier and I’m not sure who owns the property, but I think a lot of development is going to start going north and actually about to experience the same problems on the west side of the river that we are experiencing with East St. Paul will start to happen more and more on the West St. Paul side although I mean we are providing the sewer services into West St. Paul and those areas, but I’ll leave it at that. I just wanted to say, I know that there are a number of people who are concerned in both the Old Kildonan Ward and in the Mynarski Ward that that forest that's always been there is part of what was Old Kildonan is there for the wildlife because the wildlife really has with the developments that happen with…basically east of the Winnipeg Beach main line and what will happen west of it coming up. I think that it's important that they do look at combining priorities for other precincts that would develop in that area to maintain the forest as well as that opportunity for wildlife, but also for the people who will live in the residences around that area. So thank you.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Pagtakhan.</P>
<P class="p42 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’m just jealous of Councillor Orlikow with his Starbucks here. I wanted to take the opportunity, Madam Speaker, just to put a few comments on the record. You know, this is the third precinct plan we’ve seen in the northwest Winnipeg in the last 18 months and it's a great news story, I think for the City of Winnipeg as it really is a signal that the city is growing. I want to thank the planners through our…in the gallery here today, I see Mr. Brian Ward and Mr. John Wintrup and I also saw Mr. David Jopling here earlier from MMM Group. I applaud for them for the great work that they’re doing on behalf of their client Mr. John Brick and just to applaud him as well for his vision and see the opportunity here, Madam Speaker to develop this area, which will really bring in hundreds of new homes, a wide variety of houses, condos, mix 10 year residential and commercial in the area. We had a chance to look at it a community committee, make some revisions relative to active transportation and sidewalks. And so this is really good news and we just wanted to…I just wanted to put a few comments on the record just to say that we appreciate the development that’s happening in northwest Winnipeg and we certainly welcome any more and all development from development community.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p61 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. That was a very good introduction in terms of the three different precinct plans that have been passed in northwest Winnipeg in the past 18 months. This one is not the most westerly but I wanted to draw attention to the fact that we do get some criticism sometimes here about not planning for green spaces and not planning for the long term and that is…I want to commend the Mayor and you, Madam Speaker, for supporting. Motion that came out of the Mayor’s Environmental Advisory Committee that I chaired last week, we are going to be having a public consultation in late May, on the future of Little Mountain Park in one of these odd situations where the park belongs to no Councillor. It's actually outside the boundaries of the city but it’s City property. It’s in circled as my learned colleague suggested, there are two other examples: Blumberg and LaBarriere, but Little Mountain is entirely encircled by the RM of Rosser, but an important resource for the northwest part of the city, the City of Winnipeg residents and we’re expanding. And so, in light of that, we know we’re expanding these new precincts up in the northwest if you look at the map that’s on…is attachment to a lot of these precincts T and some of the other ones are up in that northwest region. So we’re taking advantage of that to take a look, to see what we can do with Little Mountain Park 160 acres of prime, city, a park land. I won’t be as eloquent as Councillor Eadie’s discussion of where the deer and antelope roam, but it’s a park that a lot of…a lot of positive feedback that we aren’t going to pave it, we aren’t going to sell it. They’re going to talk to people about what needs to be done there. There may be some tension, the future as Chief Peguis comes over and comes right next to us, but CentreVenture has been very…Centreport has been very</P>

<P class="p65 ft2">supportive of this saying, we want to keep it as green space, so it’s going to be an important resource to be set precinct up in the northwest. So I think the city is planning for the future. Look forward to your support, Madam Speaker, at that public consultation that’s coming up. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers? Councillor Browaty to close.</P>
<P class="p105 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Again, this is a proof that not all development in Winnipeg happens in the southwest quadrant. It's…it’s great to see that there is interest still within…sorry, councillor, that there is interest, there’s market demand and there is growth and progress in the city. Again, Our Winnipeg which was adopted by this council isn't just about suburbs and just about suburbs. The reality is we are growing up and we are growing out. The Conference Board of Canada has proven numbers that say that you know we’re…the City of Winnipeg continues to grow and people want to have a choice in where they live. This is a case where people are choosing to live inside the City of Winnipeg instead of going out to these bedroom communities. The option instead of this particular development isn’t Waverly West or Sage Creek. It’s West St. Paul. It’s East St. Paul in many cases. So this is capturing people here in the City of Winnipeg where they’re close to all the amenities people appreciate, transit and with a little bit of luck, perhaps Phase 3 of Chief Peguis Trail, which again, the City owns most of the land going back to the 60s. This is part of our transportation planning exercises and they have the capacity. I mean Chief Peguis Trail isn’t going to be expensive, but by comparison to what we need to in south Winnipeg, widening Kenaston Boulevard, underpass on Waverley. This provides a lot of additional development space without additional cost. Again, this was identified as a precinct for future development and is consistent with our Winnipeg and therefore I think needs to be supported and as was by our Public Service. I was also informed that the Forestry Department did identify a particularly valuable stand of aspen trees in this precinct and based on that consultation, that area is being preserved in fact. You’re right, you won't see the deer and the antelope, but again, this is looking at some of the more valuable pieces in there so.</P>

I’m going to try to give some justice to this particular item and some clarification to you know enlighten this Council on a bit of <NOBR>co-operation</NOBR> and doing the right thing from this particular developer. So it's a…somewhat fairly complicated, but to make a long story short, Madam Speaker, we rezoned this land to <NOBR>multi-family</NOBR> and it was previously zoned as parkland. So where did this…where did the $350,000 come from in the first place when we dealt with it at a community committee and that number came, Madam Speaker, because for the 27,000 square…27,000 some odd square feet that that parcel of land was, which was a previously designated as park, a similar size portion, Madam Speaker, would be in the order of magnitude of 180 to 200,000. So let's just say 200,000. And if we’re going to replace a playground on that structure of 27,000 square feet, Madam Speaker, it's common knowledge from our staff and parks and playgrounds that a similar size structure would be in the order of magnitude of 150 somewhat thousand dollars. So that’s where we originally got $350,000. Later on, Madam Speaker, it was…you know, I think we realized that this piece of park land was actually owned and purchased by the developer from the City, who then rezoned it and as park land, and that there was agreement between the City of Winnipeg through a development agreement with this particular developer to actually build a play structure on this piece of land. It was now rezoned as park. The developer can see that there was a bit of a misunderstanding, and that’s okay. That happens in life, misunderstandings happen, but what I do want to stress, Madam Speaker, is that he’s taken upon himself to do the right thing. He’s going to build a park on that structure once he completes the residential development in this area, and that’s just of his own volition, Madam Speaker. However, he is also amenable, he’s also agreeable, Madam Speaker to giving up the hundred thousand dollar letter of credit that he’s already posted with the City of Winnipeg. And in addition, Madam Speaker, the question that I had to ask…that I was asking is okay now that this land is owned by the developer, let's take that $200,000 equation out of it. So it’ll be a number of significantly less than 350,000. What would be the gap or the delta now that we have the hundred thousand to build a play structure should the developer not do that on that particular piece of land. So let's arrive at 50,000, so that's 150,000 plus the 12 percent or so contingency gives us 170,000. And I want to thank Councillor Browaty and members of the planning committee for you know going along with that number of 170,000 and that's what we're voting on here today. Madam Speaker, I do want to say that it was digitally recorded as well that we did ask our director of planning that you know, is there some assurance that we can assure that</P>

<P class="p123 ft4">the developer does build the indicated playground structure on that piece of land and he’s indicated that, the developer, up the…the Director of Planning, that he could or that he would make sure that occupancy permits are contingent upon satisfactory completion of the landscaping and play structure at that now reduced parcel of land that was previously zoned as parkland, now residential. So I hope that was a bit clearer. And I just find…I just really want to say Madam Speaker that you know I’m not trying to be overly kind to the developer, but I do want to say that I think that he’s trying to do the right thing here. I think that he was a…unfortunately cast in a bad light in the media, but you know, he is agreeing to build a park, playground structure on that piece of land as well as agree with the $170,000 contribution that we’re asking him to contribute back to the City of Winnipeg, be now invested into the land dedication reserve for use within the community. So I think this is a really good news story, and I also want to commend him for this infill development he took on. This is just part of a…this is part of a smaller piece of a larger development that took place that's infill development in a very mature neighbourhood, he’s building modern condominiums, the geothermal heating system, mechanical system, Madam Speaker. So you know, there’s a lot of good things happening here. There’s a high demand for new housing and condominiums within this area. He’s satisfying that need. He’s building a playground structure. He’s making the $170,000 contribution and I’m looking for Council's support on that.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Madam Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you. Any further speakers on the item? Councillor Browaty to close.</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Clearly, it's an unfortunate circumstance where a developer went against what was granted. I think we’ve gone down a path now where it's clear that you know there are repercussions from your actions and I think that the Councillor for the area has come up with a reasonable solution to this unfortunate circumstance.</P>

<P class="p83 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’ll be really brief and I just wanted to acknowledge the hard work and yeoman's work that Ms Jodi Ramgotra has worked so hard to do. She’s been waiting to this entire Council meeting up there. So I just want to thank her and her and her board and her staff for bringing in 40 new daycare spots and repurposing a building that was being, formerly utilized by Tyndall Park Community Centre. She’s putting in I believe almost half a million dollars. She’s cobbled together half a million dollars which is no small feat for a community organization and at the same time, Madam Speaker, in the evening, she has indicated that is going to be open for community use. So a great news story, glad to see that on the agenda, glad to speak to it and glad to thank Ms Jodi Ramgotra for the hard work she’s done.</P>
