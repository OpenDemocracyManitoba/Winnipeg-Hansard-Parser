<P class="p8 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, June is ALS Awareness Month. ALS also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a fatal, rapidly progressing disease that leads to the paralysis of the body’s involuntary muscles. Unfortunately, there is no known cure and very little in the way of treatment. Eighty percent of the people with ALS die within two to five years of diagnosis, unable to breathe or swallow. Currently, over 3,000 Canadians including approximately 260 Manitobans are affected by ALS. For over thirty years, the ALS Society of Manitoba has worked hard to deliver programs, information and services to people affected by ALS. The ALS Society of Manitoba strives to improve the quality of life for people struggling with ALS by helping them to make informed decisions about their care and providing support for their families and caregivers. ALS Awareness Month is about recognizing the importance of education and research, with the hope of one day eliminating this devastating disease. Today, members of Council are wearing the ALS Cornflower Pin, symbolizing our strength, hope and support for those living with ALS. Although this disease remains a mystery, what is known is that those living with ALS are not alone. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to invite Diane Rasmussen, the Executive Director of ALS Society of Manitoba to say a few words, please.</P>
<P class="p9 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Diane, welcome.</P>
<P class="p10 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Diana Rasmussen: </SPAN>Good morning, Mayor Katz, members of the City Council. And thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. I recognize that you’ve had a busy schedule and some long days and evenings, but my message is about hope; hope for people with ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease. As Mayor Katz mentioned, ALS, known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is a fatal neuromuscular disease. Eighty percent of the people with ALS die within two to five years, of late we are seeing more and more people dying much sooner, anywhere from three weeks, three months and the three to five years that people generally in text books live is getting shorter and shorter. These people die because they are unable to breathe; maybe unable to swallow and they are debilitated. They may be able to hear you, they may be able to see you, but they may not, and they may able to understand, but they may not be able to respond. Ten percent of those individuals may live a little bit longer than the three to five years. There is no known cure or effective treatment yet. The ALS Society of Manitoba was founded in 1980. We are a volunteer organization committee to providing support for ALS clients and their families and caregivers by means of education, a provision of equipment. This year alone, we spent over $60,000 on equipment. In the life time of somebody living with ALS, in that short period of time, they may spend anywhere from up to 400,000 dollars on equipment if they were to buy their own. Most people cannot afford that, and that’s where the ALS Society comes in… is we provide the equipment to them, free of charge on a loan program. We also provide advocacy and other program, like the <NOBR>Brummitt-Feasby</NOBR> ALS House, the only home with care and support in North America for the people living with ALS. This home has four beds and is full all the time. Has three long term beds and one bed for respite. We are also committed to raising funds to support research towards the cause and to find a cure for ALS. And as mentioned about 3,000 people live in Canada with ALS. Manitoba has the highest per capita incidents of ALS in Canada, and currently, Mayor Katz mentioned there were 260 people living with ALS in Manitoba, that number in the last four weeks has now risen to 270 individuals living with ALS. This number may not seem like it’s very high. However, the incidence of ALS is actually higher than MS because people die faster. The number of clients served by the ALS Society of Manitoba has increased from over 65 percent since 2007 and as our numbers continue to increase, so do the requests for equipment and other support services. Our vision is that a cure will be found and persons living with ALS will realize their full potential and a society that respects their rights and dignity. The mission of the ALS Society of Manitoba is one of hope to help out people every way we can. On behalf of the ALS Society of</P>

<P class="p14 ft2">Manitoba, I would like to thank our donors, volunteers, and staff for their continued support to us. But I’d also like to thank you, the City of Winnipeg, for their acknowledgement of June as ALS Awareness Month and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.</P>
<P class="p15 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Diane. Just post notes to that is that <NOBR>Brummitt-Feasby</NOBR> House is in St. Charles Ward on Kirby Drive and is a very important member of our community out there, so thank you very much. Mayor Katz, continue. You have more information.</P>
<P class="p16 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to rise and congratulate Mr. Jonathan Toews, the captain of the Chicago Blackhawks, and as we all know, a Winnipegger, for winning the Stanley Cup. I know the hockey fans will know that this feat has been accomplished twice by Jonathan and the Chicago Blackhawks in the last four years. I believe we would all agree that Jonathan is a great player, a great leader and a great role model. I would also like to congratulate both Patrick Sharp and Duncan Keith, both are basically assistant captains and many people may not know both born in Winnipeg. So congratulations Jonathan, you certainly did demonstrate phenomenal perseverance and leadership and congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks<SPAN class="ft10">.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p17 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, Mayor Katz. I have one announcement and this came to me, actually on our last Council day, May the 28th and it was actually addressed to His Worship Mayor Katz, so it was forwarded to me. It’s from the Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators and it’s recognizing our very capable City Clerk, Mr. Richard Kachur, for his 20 years of municipal service in a management capacity. His recognition pin has been presented to him directly. So Richard, congratulations on your 20 years. (Applause)</P>

<P class="p29 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I’ll speak first on Item 4, the Open Date Catalogue. When this was brought forward, this was brought forward by myself and Councillor Orlikow as a motion and I still don't see the level of transparency that we’re hoping or that I was hoping at least, and that was inherent or implied in the original motion. If we did, we would probably see things like the Emterra contract up on the web, City's web site, fines against that, Public Works plans, bid opportunities that were awarded and so forth. Other cities have far more information and available for their citizens and so, this was a little disappointing to come back in this way. I understand that this has been presented as an addendum to an already passed similar kind of motion, yet I still don't feel that it will be as extensive so those were my thoughts.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further comments? Mayor Katz.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the comments and as I think the Councillor has stated, this is something that actually is being done right now in conjunction with FIPPA and I think in the end you’ll probably get exactly what we would all like to see.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any questions? All those in favour? Opposed? Carried. Item 5.</P>
<P class="p32 ft1">Item 5 – Responsible Winnipeg Campaign - Expenditures</P>
<P class="p33 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, once again, I’d love to hear from Councillor Havixbeck and then I would be happy to respond.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>First of all, I still stand by what I've said that there is no excuse for this kind of an expenditure whether it's $90,000, $69,000, whatever it is. I still disagree with that in principle, spending this kind of money to lobby other councillors, however, I appeared at EPC to ask the question about obtaining more detail about some of this information and in specific, about radio production, video production, those questions weren't answered. So, for the record, I’d like to be recorded as having asked those, as well, the web site continued to be live, long after this list was provided. In fact, for almost two weeks and web sites aren't free, so I guess I still have questions as do taxpayers about whether someone was in fact paying for it and whether it is beyond these costs? So therefore, I cannot accept this as a final costing.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel, Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As a taxpayer, I’d just like to say that I was pleased to see the City finally doing some positive communication in response to some of the negatives that were constantly faced with. I guess I’d like to hear that the Mayor and somebody talk about some of the monies that we put forward in the 2013 budget for policy development and communication, I think we had about $700,000, maybe more than that in there, and where we might see some of that policy money being allocated and where the entire block of money is. But I don't want to lose track, you know, with that question, I don’t or with that statement, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that I truly believe that it's important that as a city council that we're out there doing positive communication to ensure that when messages are put out there that are greatly exaggerated or have spin or misleading tone to them, to try and you know, be used for political purposes to paint something in a negative light that we do our best to make sure that we get all the information out there even if we have to exaggerate a position to a certain degree in order to get people involved in the conversation. So, I wasn't you know, a hundred percent behind the campaign as it went out, but I was pleased with the approach to getting out there and challenging some of the misinformation that's often put out there and stretched out further in the media. So, but I would still like to hear some report back on the rest of that communication and policy development money that was included in the 2013 budget process.</P>

<P class="p14 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I disagree with Councillor Swandel. I wasn't happy about that whole campaign. And when I opened the paper and saw the Free Press ad, I wondered who was behind it. I couldn't find out. You know, I talked to a number of people. I looked at the web site; there was no mention of the City of Winnipeg. It was devious and it shakes the public…</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Councillor Swandel: <SPAN class="ft2">To the bone.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>But it shakes the public up. It doesn't…it's not reasonable to be so sneaky. I mean, if we really wanted to put the case forward, we should do it openly and with ads clearly that it's the university…that it's the City of Winnipeg doing it. Now, with the list of things that have been submitted by the Mayor, I’d like some explanation what Direct Focus creative 10,000 and Direct Focus microsite 7,000. So I’d like an explanation of what those are.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Gerbasi followed by Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p36 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wasn't going to speak to this, but to hear this described as positive, just sort of made me want to make a couple of comments on the record, too. I think it was really quite a diminishment of respect to this chamber that resulted from that campaign and I think it's significant enough that that needs to be said. You know, that money that was set aside for policy was not being spent on policy, it was being spent on public relations and a very politically driven public relations campaign, which I don't think was the intention of policy money. You know, I also object to that policy money is strictly for the Mayor's office and controlled by that. It should be policy for all of Council, but at least, if it was being used towards policy itself, that would be more positive. You know, to just simply have a huge whack of PR, political funds to be used in this manner, and it really did fall flat and I think Councillor Smith's description of it as devious, you know, unfortunately, is how it was perceived, probably accurately by many people. So I think it just has to be said that this was not a positive campaign. Let's hope it doesn't happen again. Let's hope we don't see continued campaigns as the Chair of Finance has indicated, that intends to continue with these types of campaigns. I just hope that isn't the case because it certainly didn't do any of us as elected officials a favour in terms of our status and respect from the public with that kind of campaign going on. So those are my comments, thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p37 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>And here I was worried that the year of discussing the golf courses had passed. I would have to find a new hobby. I don’t think…we can’t really debate the cost. I mean, Councillor Havixbeck raises some points. So this isn't a vote. This is a vote on the report of how much it cost, but we seem to have delved into a debate on the merits of the whole campaign, and I don't want to be accused of agreeing with those who are speaking well of the campaign if I remain silent. So I’ll just say the campaign clearly from my view was misdirected, it should’ve been, as Councillor Smith said, much more open. If we are saying what we have to respond to other's negative campaigns, then we should be saying who the authors of the campaigns are, we shouldn't be clinging onto another initiative of Responsible Winnipeg if it's the first initiative of Responsible Winnipeg, we shouldn't be saying things like, “We're losing 800,000, then we’re going to save 500,000 and pay down our debt.” Because eight minus five does not equal negative one or negative eight plus five, it’s not equal plus one, however you want to spin it, those numbers were mixing apples and oranges. The numbers weren't being straightforward. To say keep our golf courses accessible and by the way we'll be surrendering control of the green fees for the next 20 years was also, I think, to be kind, more than a bit of an exaggeration or a stretch so I don't think in future, this is the kind of campaign we should see. We certainly have the right as a city to put forward our position but this was, in essence directed to lobby people with their City Councillors on information that clearly, clearly, clearly, wasn't full and wasn't accurate. It isn't accurate to say we were losing 800,000 and if we saved 500,000, we would be making a profit. I mean, that's just undebatable. So I don't really want to dwell on the cost that is passed, but as we seem to have stumbled into a debate on the merits of the campaign, I certainly wanted to make my comments on the record.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want just to…I wasn't planning to speak on this, but I think I will now. You know, I think you know, it's darned if you do and it’s darned if you don't kind of thing is the old expression. I think there is</P>

<P class="p29 ft13">another word, but I won't use it. But you know, we…there is no doubt that when the campaign came out, the logo as was pointed out should’ve been…there’s no doubt about that, absolutely and I’ve said that on the chamber. I think I’ve even said the <NOBR>a-word.</NOBR> I apologize, you know. S, sorry. heaven forbid. You know, yeah, you know, the key thing here is that it got a discussion going and it got a debate going about these services that we are offering and whether we should be offering them or not, and the cost, Mr. Speaker, the costs and what we're losing in terms of the revenues with regards to offering and subsidizing golf, yes, subsidizing golf. That's what we're doing. Everybody agrees with that. Everybody is not arguing that. We actually have…we are subsidizing golf for those who want to play golf, and at the same time, we can't afford enough room for our children to go to learn how to swim in this city. The kids can't get into learn to swim programs. We don't have enough space, we don’t have enough programming but we have money to subsidize those who can go and play golf. That is the city we live in today. So, Mr. Speaker, I think it's important to point out that this…you know, you don’t like…I find it ironic that members of the New Democratic Party are standing up today and criticizing this advertising when their own party spends ten times more advertising in terms of their provincial budget that just shafted the people of Manitoba with regards to this one percent sales tax. They…ten times, but we can't find that number out, Mr. Speaker, because that, you know, heaven forbid, and the details on that, why are these same members of Council not rising up and demanding that the Premier immediately release his budget expenditures, where that money is being spent right down to the last nickel since there’s no longer a penny. It's not being done, Mr. Speaker. They’re not doing it because they can't, because the Premier said you can't stand up and speak for the people, you have to sit down and be quiet. And that's the reality, Mr. Speaker, that's the reality. And so, we see this double standard, a double standard with regards to this, which is a fraction, Mr. Speaker, this would’ve been a fraction of what the savings could’ve been annually. And you know, but you know, I understand that. That's the politics and that's the way it is, but I think the public should be aware of that side of it as well, and that's why I want to put these comments on the record. And I want to thank the Mayor for his…I mean the reality is, Council with a <NOBR>two-thirds</NOBR> majority requirement defeated the required…the need for leasing out. I think it was a great opportunity for us to reduce our losses dramatically and at the same time, offer golf and at the same time, ensure actually that golf, public golf courses would’ve been there for the next 20 years because we would’ve been locked into a 20 year lease. I mean, it was a great opportunity to ensure that and that's the irony in all of this, Mr. Speaker, because I think that was missed in this whole debate. So thanks very much.</P>

<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Orlikow: </SPAN>I just want to rise and besides trying to find the boogieman out there, we don't have enough money for swimming pools, okay. Well, you know, we do have… we have $700,000 for this lobbying campaign from the Mayor's office, we have money for that. We have money to raise our CAR allowances. We have money for that. We have money to do a budget consultation which I don't have a lot of support for. I don't see it actually working. So we do have money, but we do make choices. So there is money for swimming, we make…we can make…if we make the choice to do it, we can. But we are making other choices that are costing us money as well. So let's put that, that's the facts. It's not about some…let's shift the blame off to the Province or shift it off to someone else. It's the actions that we do here today. So we are allocating money to certain areas, and doing so, we are taking money away from those swimming pools. Those are our actions. That’s not the Provincial Government’s action. That's us so again, let's take responsibility for what we are doing.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Seeing no further, Mayor Katz would you like to close?</P>
<P class="p39 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I will try to address the issue, which was a question, Mr. Speaker. Number one, Mr. Speaker, all of the expenses have been provided to Council and the media. Those are all the total costs, Mr. Speaker. It's in black and white. As you know, if we had acted, I think, within probably around five hours of the motion, which we wouldn’t even be discussing this because I believe that was for 60 days so who knows how much longer would’ve taken. It was nice to get it all out there in black and white, and for anybody to basically say that well, they’re not buying it, I guess you could say that about any Councillor’s expenses that I find that to be a little ridiculous. I’ll leave that at that. I know that Councillor Swandel asked a question about policy and I can tell him that there are ads running right now to hire those people and on the issue, I heard the comments about actions. Well, Mr. Speaker, this whole issue isn’t about action, it’s actually about inaction. We had a very long and thorough debate, and we made a decision not to do anything, but in the meantime by not doing anything, it's a kin to basically playing an ostrich and burying your head in the sand and pretending there isn't a problem. You can say you don't believe the consultants. It's</P>

You can say you don't believe the auditors and if that's the case, I guess you’ve got to ask the question why have consultants and auditors if you can just throw out everything they said, but the reality is that's been done. But the other side of the coin is the problem is not going away. There’s one Councillor who basically stood up on the floor other than yours truly and basically said “the SOA for golf is not working”. That was Councillor Smith who actually said that. In the meantime, what are we doing?

<P class="p47 ft1">Motion No. 1</P>
<P class="p48 ft1">Moved by His Worship Mayor Katz,</P>
<P class="p48 ft1">Seconded by Councillor Wyatt,</P>
<P class="p49 ft16">WHEREAS on January 29, 2013 Council approved in the Capital Budget that the remaining amount of $3.8 million from the City's Recreation and Leisure Facilities Policy be allocated to the remaining 14 wards ($271,428 each) for recreation and leisure facilities;</P>
<P class="p35 ft16">AND WHEREAS on May 27, 2010, the City of Winnipeg and Province of Manitoba had entered into an Agreement for the Building Communities Initiative (BCI) II, providing for participation of each party in promoting community revitalization in designated neighbourhoods in the City of Winnipeg;</P>
<P class="p49 ft16">AND WHEREAS the City of Winnipeg and Province of Manitoba have agreed to reallocate the unallocated balance of <NOBR>MW-RLIP</NOBR> <NOBR>(Manitoba-Winnipeg</NOBR> Recreation and Leisure Infrastructure Program) of $3,800,000 ($1,520,000 Manitoba (40%) and $2,280,000 Winnipeg (60%)) to BCI II;</P>
<P class="p35 ft16">THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City enter into an agreement (the “BCI II Amending Agreement”) with the Province of Manitoba to reallocate the $3,800,000 unallocated <NOBR>MW-RLIP</NOBR> funds to projects under the Building Communities II Program which support the revitalization and stabilization of mature residential neighbourhoods in the city of Winnipeg, and such other agreements as determined necessary by the City Solicitor / Director of Legal Services to implement the intent of the foregoing;</P>
<P class="p49 ft16">AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT authority be delegated to the Chief Administrative Officer to negotiate and approve the terms and conditions of the BCI II Amending Agreement and such other agreements as required pursuant to the foregoing recommendation, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the foregoing recommendation and such other terms and conditions deemed necessary by the City Solicitor / Director of Legal Services to protect the interests of the City;</P>
<P class="p49 ft16">AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the Public Service be directed to submit the current list of endorsed projects for approval by BCI Policy Committee (Mayor and Minister of Local Government or designates) in accordance with the BCI II Agreement as amended.</P>
<P class="p49 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I think as you’re aware of…there has been money allocated for all City Councillors, all 15, basically to be used for recreational facilities within their ward. There’s been dialogue back and forth between the Provincial Government. We now have concurrence and we’re ready to move forward as you can see. I moved it, it was seconded by Councillor Wyatt who has been pushing to get this done as quickly as possible. I think it's pretty much black and white. And if anybody has any questions, I’d be happy to try to address them but as you know this is a sound investment in recreational facilities throughout the entire city and every Councillor would have the opportunity to improve recreational facilities within their ward.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes followed by Councillor Orlikow.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>I don't actually have my speaking instructions from the Premier yet, but I’ll just wing it there from Councillor Wyatt. Very pleased to see this come forward. I want to commend Councillor Wyatt. This was part of the budget. I did raise this with Councillor Wyatt during the budget that there would be provincial approval required. We had some debate I think last month on this, obviously both sides want to move it forward, both sides want to get it signed off. I’m very pleased to see this moving along quickly. I was pleased to see it as part of the budget from Councillor Wyatt, so I’ll certainly be supportive.</P>

<P class="p53 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Alright, we have question period for the Mayor. Havixbeck followed by Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Keep losing my monitor here. I want to ask through you to the Mayor, in regards to the Golf Course initiative which was brought forward to Council last month. The EOI closed October 26<SPAN class="ft17">th</SPAN>, 2011 at 4 p.m. I’d like to know if the Mayor doesn’t know today, if he could tell us what date was the bid received from the <NOBR>Ontario-based</NOBR> firm, GolfNorth?</P>
<P class="p54 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I don’t have that date on the top of my head but I’d be happy to provide that to the Councillor.</P>
<P class="p56 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Throughout that process, the two local bidders that were also competing for that…the lease portion, indicated to me that they were both higher in their contributions of capital and operating. Can the Mayor confirm for us whether or not one or both of these firms were higher than the <NOBR>Ontario-based</NOBR> firm.</P>
<P class="p47 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Your Worship.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, no they were not.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Relative to the Police Station on Grant Avenue, is it true that remediation was required and was <NOBR>un-anticipated</NOBR> to the cost of an additional $500,000 as a cost to the City of Winnipeg.</P>
<P class="p25 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Not to my knowledge Mr. Speaker. No.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councilor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p58 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. Recently we saw the opening of the Bomber stadium, and it certainly highlighted the <NOBR>on-going</NOBR> need to complete the Rapid Transit to the University, and I guess this morning, I saw in the paper that the scope of the project has now been expanded to include sewer work, Pembina underpass and a bunch of other things. I do understand, and we did have a seminar on this and I think we’re aware, that there are a number of works that are going to be needed in the area around the underpass and all of that. I’m not that the sewer work necessarily would have been part of a Rapid Transit project. I think that’s something that would have been happening anyway, but I guess my concern is, with the continued importance of this issue and the amount of time it’s taking to complete this, I’m concerned about how the negotiations are going and also at the last Council meeting, Councillor Wyatt made some pretty concerning comments about feeling, even suggesting cancelling the project. So with that, I guess I’m wondering, through you to the Mayor, if you could give us an update on how these negotiations are going with the Province. Are they going well? Are we going to get this resolved and get on with building Rapid Transit in Winnipeg, and completing this corridor? Thank you.</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p59 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Through you to Councillor Gerbasi, I thank her for the question and I can tell Councillor Gerbasi that I did ask the Premier for a meeting. We were at a function together. I said let’s get together and talk about that. And we agreed. We are setting up a meeting. That’s number one. So that is moving forward. Getting it resolved is quite simple Mr. Speaker. Just a matter of, you know, the Provincial Government finding another 18 to 20 million dollars and we move forward. It’s not that difficult a challenge to start off with. It’s just a matter of coming up with more money. The other scenario Mr. Speaker, I think it’s unfortunate that people are going to start mixing apples with oranges. The Rapid Transit is the Rapid Transit. The other projects are projects that we have to have done. I think even Councillor Gerbasi concurred with the Jubilee underpass etcetera, and it was just pointed out, quite simply, to the Provincial Government, that if we do them together at the same time, it would save a lot of money. I’m sure Mr. Speaker, you and every Councillor sitting here at points in time have gotten calls from citizens saying, why are you just digging up this road or</P>

<P class="p62 ft4">the sidewalk, you just repaired it. It’s because one department does something one day and then you’ve got to change it and put in sewer etc., or sometimes it’s Hydro etc. All they’re doing is coordinating everything so we don’t have to build something brand new and dig it up. I think the Administration should be highly recommended for pointing that out and making everyone aware of it. And the other scenario Mr. Speaker, these are projects, capital projects, for infrastructure that need to be done. There’s no secrets or surprises. Everybody here knows about that. Obviously there are options out there for getting money and we’re just putting it on the table that these projects make sense to do at the same time and as we all know, Provincial Government just said, they want to invest a lot of money in infrastructure. We’re just giving them opportunities Mr. Speaker, because there are lots of them, and these are good projects.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>So I guess my question then is, in spite of the comments Councillor Wyatt made at the last meeting, are you, through you to the Mayor, Mr. Mayor are you remaining optimistic that we will get this project resolved, at least negotiations with the Province resolved and that we will get this project moving at least somewhere near the time lines we’ve envisioned.</P>
<P class="p54 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I’m going to answer the question for them to say is that I don’t respond to comments by other people, whether it’s Councillor Gerbasi or Councillor Wyatt. Every Councillor here is elected in a democratic process and they have the right to freedom of speech. That’s number one. Number two, the City of Winnipeg has already moved forward on that. We committed to go out there and borrow the money for basically a Phase 2 as we call it, based on <NOBR>50-50</NOBR> with the Province and the City, okay. That’s a major commitment. This Council has said we’re going to do that. We’re just waiting for the Provincial Government to agree to the <NOBR>50-50</NOBR> as was done in Phase 1 of Rapid Transit following the same model. We do have the opportunity where the Federal Government has a program where they will come up with 25% of the money and as you probably heard in the past Mr. Speaker, there’s been a lot of comments about Building Canada funds, Building Canada funds, Building Canada funds. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you right now so nobody is…does not have the right impression and the understanding. Any one of the projects that we have out there are going to eat up all of the Building Canada funds, and I can tell you any time a proponent comes forward to other levels of government with a great project, you know where they’re directed Mr. Speaker? To Building Canada funds. If the City makes this a priority, we’ll be there. The realities are Mr. Speaker, highly unlikely we’re going to get more than $200 million in Building Canada funds. We all know the cost of Rapid Transit, so let’s just stop playing the game of Building Canada funds. We can use that money for many other projects and there are good projects all throughout the City that all three levels of government will support. So number one, do I believe we’re going to move on this quickly? Yes, the City has. Number two, do I believe that the Province and the City will come to an agreement? As I said Mr. Speaker, we’re talking 18 to 20 million dollars okay? The Provincial Government just raised half a billion dollars in new revenues. I think they can find 18 to 20 million dollars one time.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question Councillor Gerbasi.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you very much Mr. Mayor and my last question has to do with the audit. There was some talk in the media in the last few days that the audit on the fire halls, I guess the first part of the larger audit, is in the works. I’m wondering if you could advise Council as to when that is likely to come forward to a public meeting at E.P.C., the Audit Committee, and will that be in July or do you have any idea, and what will that process be. I’m assuming it will just simply go straight to the Audit Committee?</P>
<P class="p64 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>First of all Mr. Speaker, call for the audit. After that we’re basically removed from the process. This is done by the Auditor who, as you know, hired an independent, <NOBR>out-of-province</NOBR> consultant to do the work. That’s number one. Number two, Councillor Gerbasi is correct. Once that is done, the Auditor will bring it forward and it moves through the exact same process…I believe the Audit Committee and then it will go to Council.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Mayes.</P>
<P class="p65 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Mayes: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. My question also pertains to traffic at the Investors Group Field. I want to commend the Mayor’s Office and Dave Wardrop, our head of Transit, for working on that. Things seemed to go a lot better at the concert, but it’s second down tomorrow night I guess in terms of the second Bombers game at the stadium, once we get the results from that, a lot of people in my ward, and we do have St. Vital rep on the Event Day Committee.

We’re putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in to improve the boat launch at St Vital Park for example, so people are trying to come up with some solutions like getting there via the Red River or the other issue that occasionally comes up, the foot bridge from St. Vital over to the U. of M. campus. Some people prefer the gondola option I’m told, but the foot bridge remains an option that some people are talking about, so I don’t want to get any answers before we have the results from tomorrow’s game, but as this process unfolds I just want to make sure those options are still on the table if we need to look at other options.</P>
<P class="p67 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, first let me just <NOBR>re-iterate</NOBR> something that Councillor Mayes said to Dave Wardrop and all his staff as well as Public Works Brad Sacher and Kenny across the way and so many other staff. They did a phenomenal, phenomenal job working with the Winnipeg Football Club and True North to address these issues. As a matter of fact, I can tell you Mr. Speaker that I myself, after leaving the Taylor Swift concert with my family at about 11 o’clock, saw Dave Wardrop out in the streets. He was still there. That’s commitment Mr. Speaker, so let’s number one know that our staff did a remarkable job, and I can tell you, I’ve gotten thank yous from just about everybody…the Football Club, True North, the President, etc., thanking us for what we did. That’s number one. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned this publicly last time. I went to the first exhibition game. I live in the southwest part of the City. It took me about an hour and six minutes to get there. Took me about 50 minutes to get home. I went to the Taylor Swift concert. I got there in 15 minutes. The realities are, is that I would say that the exhibition game was very similar to opening a restaurant. You have a dry run to work out the kinks and yes there were many, many kinks. When I drove there I could see problems right away. There wasn’t enough signage to direct people where to go. It was the first time people were coming. They didn’t know where to go. Right lane, left lane, go straight, where’s the parking lot, what do I do? They had a lot of volunteers there trying to do their job but they didn’t have the authority to make swift decisions and direct people who went into the wrong place trying to turn around. There was not enough Transit available for that game as well, and as I have <NOBR>re-iterated</NOBR> to everyone in the media, the Blue Bombers contract our buses, okay. They contract out and we charge them. Just like they contracted out charter buses as well as school buses. If anybody was at the last event, you would have seen they were there. They’ve also created some dedicated lanes now for buses to get in and out, so Mr. Speaker, I don’t know if anybody has seen this but if you look at the first game and see some of the things that they’ve done. You know, by showing the game ticket, you’ll be able to catch any regular Transit bus at no charge starting at 5:30 p.m. Fans should note that the traditional Blue and Gold Transit routes will not operate in order to enhance the number of buses running throughout the regular Transit network, with particular emphasis on Route 60 Pembina, Route 75 Crosstown, Route 78 Crosstown W, Crosstown West Crosstown East, Route 160 and 161. Free Park and Ride services will start at 5:30 with a game day ticket. Park and Ride locations include Assiniboine Downs, Club Regent Casino, Garden City Shopping Centre, Kildonan Place Centre, McPhillips Station Casino, Manitoba Hydro on Taylor, St. Norbert Hotel and the St. Vital Centennial Arena, as well as, they’ve increased the amount of parking where you can park in private areas and you will be charged, and I’m not going to give you the complete list, but I can tell you a significant number of changes have been made to address the problem. The realities are Mr. Speaker, you try and prepare for all the problems that may occur. Sometimes you’re not successful but you immediately address them right after that. And I would say to you Mr. Speaker that anybody who has done major events such as this, it will probably take two or three games to work out all the systems but you know, the reality is, we should all be very proud that almost <NOBR>one-third,</NOBR> <NOBR>one-third</NOBR> Mr. Speaker, of the people attending Bomber games are utilizing Transit. It’s a pretty phenomenal accomplishment which I’m not convinced anybody here would have believed except for the experts in Transit who projected that quite a while ago.</P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question Brian? Councillor Smith.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>Yes Mr. Speaker, I guess I’d like to ask that question about your advertising campaign, Responsible Winnipeg. What is the Direct Focus 10,000 and Direct Focus 2,000. What exactly are those?</P>
<P class="p68 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, the $10,000 is for the entire creative, anytime you have the campaign there’s creative and basically putting the entire…the development of the content of the campaign. That’s what that’s for, and I know that sometimes people get confused but Microsite is sometimes another name for the website which can confuse people but hopefully that addresses the concerns of the Councillor.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Smith: </SPAN>My second question Mr. Mayor is concerning Councillor Wyatt’s suggestion for Wyatt days. What is your reaction to that, or are you rejecting that idea completely or are you going to accept Wyatt days from Councillor Wyatt?</P>

<P class="p14 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, like any idea that comes forward, as Councillor Smith should know, there is a process. This recommendation is going to our Administration to report back, give us the pros and cons, and it won’t be Councillor Smith or Councillor Wyatt or Mayor Katz accepting or rejecting anything, it will be all Council. That’s the way it works here. I think Councillor Smith is very much aware of that.</P>
<P class="p54 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question? You’re done? Okay. Any further questions? Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you Mr. Speaker. There’s been reports of the Auditor going through the fire hall audit prior to it becoming public or prior to it becoming information to Councillors. Can the Mayor tell me why would our City Auditor go through it in such detail?</P>
<P class="p15 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, number one, I’m not aware that’s even a statement of fact. But number two, I was informed that our Auditor hasn’t even received the report, so I’d love to know where Councillor Havixbeck is getting her information. Maybe she could share it with me. I would appreciate that.</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I got my information from the Free Press this morning and I believe…</P>
<P class="p19 ft2">(inaudible speaking in the background)</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>If that’s where Councillor Havixbeck is getting all her information, I think she should basically refrain from making questions or comments based on reports from the Winnipeg Free Press.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>This is further to my questioning along the golf courses. It seems to me that this was something of significance to Council, an initiative put before us to vote on. Lots of Councillors had lots of questions. We asked the administration for answers to our questions. Does the Mayor think that perhaps in future, for something of such significance that perhaps a Council seminar might be in order?</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Councillor for that question, and I can tell you that after the last Council meeting where Council voted against taking the action based on the recommendations of both the Auditor and the CFO etc., I actually had a conversation with Councillor Smith who basically…and he and I talked about having a Council seminar and we have asked the administration to have a Council seminar because as I said earlier, this problem is not going to go away and Council needs to address it one way or the other.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>A few months back, I asked a question about insurance on our civic buildings, and I put forward a motion, and the motion was eventually revised into holding a Council seminar so that our administration could tell us how much insurance, of what nature we have on our civic buildings, and in particular I referenced the community centre in Councillor Steen’s ward where we realized that we had insufficient insurance to cover the entire cost and that’s now being done, <NOBR>re-done,</NOBR> that community centre, within the 2013 budget, and so my question to the Mayor is when will we see that Council seminar to explain in detail the insurance on civic buildings?</P>
<P class="p67 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I think the first thing you’d have to do is give the administration the opportunity to gather all the information and get all the facts. I have not heard from any department regarding that. I haven’t heard from the C.F.O., but when they have that information I would be more than happy to have a Council seminar, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p15 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any other questions for the Mayor at this time? Okay, we’ll leave 11 minutes on the table sir. So, all right, we’ll move to the report of the Standing Policy Committee for Property and Development, Councillor Browaty.</P>

<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Browaty.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>I’m quite…interested to hear Councillor Gerbasi's questions and will respond.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m supportive of the report and what we're doing, we're basically purchasing the station rather than proceeding with the P3 that was approved. I guess I’m just wondering though if we could get an explanation of how we got to the point of going into a major P3 proposal and then having to switch gears. This stage, maybe we could get some more information about how it turned out, to be a not very effective option in terms of financing it that way, and that we had to take this measure at this stage of the process. So I just really wanted to get some answers on that because it’s just curious that we would go into a P3 project and then at this stage, have to buy back the building, and basically back pedal from the P3 and I’d just like to know what went wrong and to get some more explanation. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and just to add a few things. This is actually a very good news story for the City of Winnipeg. You look at funding models, we know, you know, whether they are civic buildings for police or whatever else you need to look at funding models that are going to make sense. We’ve used some P3s in some areas and some areas and some areas, we use other funding models that are there. At the end of the day, we want to make sure what makes sense on a financial basis for taxpayers. So you know, the anticipated monies that we associate that point, interest rates and everything else was different than we associated. So I think it's a very positive news story that instead of going down one track and just having a ideological approach to things, which sometimes people accuse us of. We’ve made a change that’s going to make sense for taxpayers. So I think if anything, it shows an example of where the City can make a change when it makes sense on a financial basis. So let’s take a look, what model makes sense at that point. You know, going forward, we’ve got advice from our CFO and our financial advisers that this was a more prudent in terms of our costs and that was part of the agreement going forward and that’s what made sense to make a change. We’ll do it again if need be. So thank you, Mr. Speaker.</P>

<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Okay, you can ask Councillor Browaty a question during question period. Mayor Katz.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I just want to clarify a few things and you know, let's be very frank. There are members of Council who strongly believe that P3s can be a valuable tool in the right circumstances. There are other members of Council who are dead set against P3s. But when I hear a councillor asking the question using the terms back pedal using the terms what went wrong using the terms buy back, I think you can see that's where the biases are, Mr. Speaker, because the reality are or the reality is, in this particular scenario, a P3 was recommended and we moved forward on that basis, but it was also recommended based on a very specific level of interest and they projected into the future what that interest would be. And, in addition to that and we do our P3s with the due diligence that's done, written right in the agreement Mr. Speaker, is to gives us the option if we so desire to basically buy the building, we have that option. It never cost us a nickel. We save considerable money. We haven't paid any interest to date and the realities are for those people who do support P3s, we also support the other side of the coin. We know there is a point in time where P3s are good and could be a valuable asset which we've seen with Chief Peguis, which we’ve seen with Disraeli, we know based on the interest rate, there can be a point in time where it doesn't make sense, because the interest rate was basically lower than was projected and here’s a perfect example of how you do what's best for the taxpayers. That’s all I wanted to say.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further comments? Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have some concerns and however, for today, I am going to support this in its present format. I have asked the administration for information about the detail line by line items of costing. I know that the costing and the price of everything has been on budget, but I do have some concerns about things that I heard related to remediation that was needed. For me, this wasn't a debate about whether it was a P3 or not to be a P3. For me, it was a…simply about what is the most economical and efficient way to get a project done and to do it within our limited resources and using taxpayers’ money efficiently, so I will be supporting it. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further comments? Councillor Browaty to close.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If any member of Council wants to go back and look at the original report on this South District Police Station, it was very clear from the beginning, the value for money equation to do a P3 was marginal and was based on assumptions of certain levels of borrowing capacity, future rates of the City would be finding when they were actually going to…about to finance it. Turns out the rates were lower than were in the original report. The trigger was in the original agreement that allowed us to buy it back. That's exactly what happened, taxpayers went…it’s a…I think a pretty simple and good news story. We did the same thing in fact. In fact, on Disraeli, but we still got the advantages of the P3. We got everything hit, every deadline that I’m aware of up to this point. I’ve got information back three years ago and every deadline was hit or exceeded on the work on Disraeli. Yet, we were able to buy back millions of dollars in debt and save some money on that particular project too. I’m not so ideologically blind and I don’t think this Council is so ideologically blind that says P3 is the best scenario in every case, that's not the case, so again we're doing the right thing here.</P>
<P class="p17 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>No further comments? All those in favour of Item 8? Those opposed? Motion carried. We have no motions but we do have some <NOBR>by-laws.</NOBR> Councillor Browaty.</P>

<P class="p16 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Browaty: </SPAN>In all seriousness, the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, Destination Winnipeg, have all been working together on trying to make a first impression on the City. You land at Richardson International Airport, you’ve got a beautiful brand new terminal building. There are various options of getting to the various parts of the City, in particular our downtown. Councillor Smith brings up the point, Ellice and Sargent may be in fact shorter routes. Again I’m not going to dictate to the taxicab industry and to Destination Winnipeg on their recommended routes. I do see the argument of using Route 90, especially if it is fixed up and cleaned up. I think regardless, it is a primary route in our City. Complete Communities talks about making various types of roads quite attractive. I know in…I’m going to be biased. In my ward, Chief Peguis Trail looks great with the sound wall product, but I think might work very well in fact along Route 90 and not cost a fortune, so again, I thank Councillor Smith for his comment.</P>

The reason I rise on this, I think it's a…unfortunately, it's a very good motion because it's identifying and solving a problem with our existing service that we are not getting that bulky waste pickup, the bins just aren’t capable of doing that especially in areas where there’s…all over the city, but definitely in areas where there’s a lot of mobility going on. But I guess, my comment to is though, this is another cost that are going on to the City that I was told, when we started up privatizing garbage and doing this for the Emterra, this would be not part of the cost, this would be part of the savings so my question and concern is the savings that we thought we had from the service provider now, we seem to be adding on cost to fill in their gaps that they can't provide the service. Are we looking at…looking at this little more than just this one here, which has…there will be a cost when they come back to the report? There is a cost already with 311. It's just getting crushed on this. There is a cost for the fact that hydro lines are getting pulled off houses all over the place. There is a cost in public perception, the fact that waste is…and recycling are not being picked up when they’re supposed to be. So these are all costs that are being added on to an existing contract. I’m wondering if we're looking at…this is good, but are we looking at moving forward to <NOBR>re-evaluating</NOBR> the whole program?</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding, oh, I’m sorry.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Gerbasi: </SPAN>Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I agree with some of the comments Councillor Orlikow just made and there has been a call for quite some time that we have an audit of the privatization of the garbage collection</P>

<P class="p66 ft15">so this is maybe one more argument to add to that mix that we look at the true costs and look at other options for that. The other issue though that I originally wanted to rise…speak on this was I’m very pleased to see that we're extending this service, it says at least until July. Now, in certain areas of the city prior to the new garbage system, we had a zone in the areas that had a lot of rental housing and had a lot of these issues where there was a lot of bulky waste issues. It is really a different issue in different parts of the city. It affects some areas more, and we had a specific program that focused on that, and that garbage was picked up for free, that abandoned waste in those areas and then with the new system, it was sort of changed and then here we are back again adding in the service. And I guess…I’m glad we're doing that. It certainly was Broadway in my ward is one of the areas that this is an issue with so many rental, so much rental housing and transients. But I am wondering though, the wording says at least until July 31 and I guess I just wonder and perhaps the chair of the committee can clarify, what's the long term plan here? I mean, are we going to just do this till July? The problem is not going to go away. That's why we're back where we are again because the problem didn't change and it will continue to be an issue at least for certain parts of the city, it will be a bigger issue so I’m just wondering what the long term thinking is? I know the committee was looking at an arson strategy and had set up a committee which I think is great. Sometimes when you’re doing things that are preventive, then you say, “Well, we don't really need to do that anymore, it just means that those things are working then preventing the problem and when we stop them, the problem comes back, and I don't think any of us want to see us go back to what it was in 2000 and before when we had an arson crisis in the city. So I think we need, I appreciate the committees being proactive and setting up a committee but this does seem the way it's worded here to be fairly <NOBR>short-term</NOBR> and I guess I’m just wondering where this is going in the longer term but I do appreciate the initiative very much, thank you.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's a shame to hear some of this as being characterized, maybe it speaks to my comments earlier on about the need to be doing…there’s some communication. Garbage in the City of Winnipeg is not being privatized, it’s still under the control of the City of Winnipeg. It has been contracted out. So, let's make sure we understand the difference. So if you want to start putting the political spin and start chuckling in the background like Councillor Eadie does in his rude and ignorant fashion. We need to…</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Easy…easy…I’d appreciate it if you’d retract that statement, Councillor Swandel.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>So retracted. What I was about to say is this type of twisted representation of the facts speaks to the need for communication to counter that twisted communication. This is where we get stuck. We go out, we make valued decisions for the City of Winnipeg, one of which we just did around the P3 and changing it over to ownership. We do that and then we see people misrepresent the facts. The reality is we’ve had a terrible problem with bulky waste in the City of Winnipeg, especially in the inner city for many, many years, under the CUPE delivery model and under the Emterra delivery model. So the issue here is not how the delivery is happening. The issue here is we have a problem with bulky waste. So let's get to addressing it. Take the crappy politics out of it, address the problem before somebody bloody will get hurt. There…it's about arson, it's about fire, it's about danger, it's about public safety, it's about a clean, decent looking city. It's not about some debate over twisted term of privatization when it's not even what's happening. So let's get out there and do our jobs. You want to play these stupid games? Go do it somewhere else. I got elected to come here to make a better place. Not to make a better place for the NDP or the Conservatives or the Liberals, a better Winnipeg for all citizens. And that means safe and that means clean, and I’m getting sick and tired of sitting in this place, listening to that crap be spewed on this floor. Those are my comments, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p39 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Thank you, Speaker Nordman. I’d just like to start off by, on the record, that I made no politics out of this. When I moved this motion and the Mayor seconded it, it was very clear that we needed a solution to solve an arson problem and a blight on the inner city of abandoned bulk waste. And I was quoted in the media, “No politics here, simply let's get it done. I don't know how we're going to do it, but please, administration, let's get it done because it is a problem that needs to be dealt with.” So let's be clear on that. I might snicker at an idea when you say it's not privatized, the collection is privatized, but you know what, I don't want to be political about it as Councillor Swandel is trying to make it look out. What I would like to say though, is the solution that the administration came up with, with the extra day, at least</P>

<P class="p14 ft15">until July 31, coincides with an agreement, a contractual agreement that they have that our administration has with a private company and you know what, it's working. We’ve seen it in my neighbourhoods, in my…in Mynarski, it's working. It's a lot cleaner now. I mean we still have the problem. We're still trying to keep up but the point is, the improvement can already be seen. I also wanted to speak to this issue in terms of the arson problem is much bigger than just bulk and abandoned waste. However, it is very clear that in some of our plans that we have for this city, we changed our <NOBR>by-laws,</NOBR> our <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> enforcement. They’re doing a great job to get on top of people who drive into the inner city and dumb the crap or landlords who dump stuff rather than taking care of it. We know that in the Garbage Master Plan, we have resource recovery centres, I believe by next year, hopefully it's in place. There’s one on up near Keewatin, I think in…on Pacific, that's going to be great. It's a closer place for people to take the bulk waste, landlords who feel they can just dump will be able to at least go there because they’re complaining that they’ve got to haul abandoned furniture here and there, so that's important to know that there are some longer term plans that may help, but you know, the reality is where we have a lot of people moving in and out, also bed bug is also an issue. It's not just that they are moving out, there is issues of bed bugs. It’s still there and people abandon them and they chuck them out and we have people on low income and even if you ask them to pay five dollars to call in and have a mattress picked up, they’re just totally, there’s a real inherent problem in terms of garbage. So we do need a long term plan on arson and part of that long term plan on arson is to help us deal with the garbage problems, and so Councillor Fielding, seeing that there needed to be a longer term plan has put together a more holistic type of committee to look at arson which includes all these departments because really, everybody is affected. When we’re taken away from firefighters to deal with fires <NOBR>in-houses</NOBR> and so on, to deal with lit bulk waste, it's not good. So this motion that we are discussing today was a practical plan. Thank you to the Administration for getting this done because it really needed to be done and I encourage everybody to vote for it. Yes, there are problems with our collection system. It would be great if they were to improve, but on this particular issue, it isn't political. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p19 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I must confess Mr. Speaker, I’m a little surprised that this motion isn't embraced and seen for the positive that it really is. This came out of a safety issue, which I know Councillor Eadie certainly had concerns, I know Councillor Smith had concerns and the reality is, no one seems to mention the word, illegal dumping, Mr. Speaker. It’s illegal dumping, okay. And I think as a…and I will echo the comments of Councillor Eadie because it took several departments to basically work together on these issues. You're talking about the Winnipeg Police Service, Winnipeg Fire and Paramedics. You’re talking about Water and Waste, you’re talking about Public Works. They all have a role to play as well as Community Services in the enforcement of it, but this is about illegal dumping that can cause safety issues, we're concerned about arson. We're proactive and took steps immediately. Yes, there was a cost of approximately $60,000. Well, I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but if that saved one fire, if that saved someone getting injured, I’d spend that every single day. What's the value of the other potential problems that could arise? This was a sound investment. I’m very happy to hear from the councillor that things are much better, and come July 31, you can reassess the problem and see where you're going. There is no need for criticism of any kind on this motion, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p39 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think it's important because to…just to say a couple of other things, this area is highly problematic. I did a <NOBR>ride-along</NOBR> about a year ago with our Police Service and the police supervisors go up and down back lanes, bulky waste, you know, not to mention the uncleanliness and the <NOBR>health-related</NOBR> issues and concerns that I would have. And you know sometimes we have to take our ward kind of councillor look at things and that hat off and put on a city perspective and I hear lots of complaints about garbage and recycling collection and leaf bags and so forth not being picked up still in Charleswood. However, this is much deeper. This is a level of pride that we take in our city and we have to address this. I look in Councillor Eadie's ward and there are bigger raccoons than there are in Charleswood and that's because the food and garbage is everywhere. We have to address this and we have to do something. We have no idea to the amount of resources that are actually wasted. The police tell me that the firefighters actually go and hose down couches and mattresses in the back lanes so that they’re not as easy to start on fire. Well, if that's the way we’re going to use our resources, that's highly unproductive, I think, and so I think we need to clean this up and get this done literally, and this is not what I would want for our city. This policy attempts to address it. It does not</P>

<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Thank you. It's a good conversation. First of all, I commend Councillor Eadie for taking the lead with Mayor Katz to solve this problem and I think this is what this issue is about, it's about solving a problem. I can’t tell you that this problem did not start five months ago or last October when we signed the deal with Emterra. I was chair of Protection Committee, I believe Councillor Gerbasi was on the committee back in 2000. We had the…when the whole arson initiative was running rampant and there were all sorts of fires in all parts of the city, way more than there are now and that's unfortunate. How do we solve that? I think that's a longer term social issue that this recommendation is not going to solve, but the problem did not start last October. That's the point I want to make, and I commend the councillor for moving forward on this, and my question to the chair is that July 31, 2013, you know, we're prorogued and I can only hope that we're going to give the authority to the CAO to do all things necessary should the CAO need to move on this again as maybe likely. It’s going to be…it’s going to be a long, I hope, a long, hot summer and there’s benefits and there is disadvantages to that. Thank you.</P>

<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, I just want to add that we have approved four recycling stations in the city and I think that will help a big time for all these bulk waste, illegal dumping when they get closer to be able to dump garbage like mattresses or couches, TVs and all those things. So just want to add that to it.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thank you, sir. Any further comments? Seeing none, Councillor Fielding to close.</P>
<P class="p39 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And some great comments here and I think that there will be unanimous support on this motion, I’m assuming, from people. I think everyone thinks it's going in the right direction. Councillor Orlikow first brought up the dollars and cents for it. You know, it is $60,000 due. I think is money well spent if you can stop you know, one fire from happening in our community. It’s something that needs to happen. We know that it's a problem that we're seeing in our communities and Councillor Eadie had brought this up with the Mayor, and it's definitely a problem in his community and a lot of problem communities within the city and so we need to find a solution to this. This is a <NOBR>short-term</NOBR> strategy and essentially what it is, obviously it's going in to some of these hot spots where you’re having a lot of the arson issues and bulky waste in that source and going around and having extra focus in on these areas and I think it’s a strategy that makes sense. The time lines in terms of July as I’m told through our experts in fire and police that's where the bulk of the fires happen, you know, arsons happen till the end of July. I’ve got no problems at all. I think it makes a lot of sense to continue that on. It's a small price to pay I think to keep our community safe and to prevent fires so I think you know, I’ll be talking to the administration on that. I don't think that Mayor would have any concerns with that as well if we need to extend that past the July deadline, just make some sense. It did, the discussion and we have done a number of things. I’ll talk about the arson strategy too because it’s…this is really what we are talking about but essentially there has been a number of good things that have gone on. Number one, in terms of the waste minimization strategy, we’ve got rid of the auto bins, which I think is a step forward because we know whether be contractors and anyone else, anyone that had these in their communities, it became a place that people would go and they set fires. Now, you’re not going to totally prevent that. I know there is a fire on the news a little while ago you’re having more of these bins. But I think it makes it a little bit more difficult because the auto bins, the fires can grow bigger and they can catch garages on fire. That’s there…that’s one thing we did to eliminate as well. We also have done things over a year and a half ago, we had a meeting, I think Councillor, the Speaker was there and the Mayor was there as well. In my ward, we had some arson issues. After that point of last year, half the Fire Department has been going up and down lanes after calls and identifying some waste items that are bulky waste. What I hear from some of the firefighters is that they are calling these things in. It does take a while to them to have them removed and I think that's part of the strategy going forward. We also have developed a long term strategy for arson, and that was getting everyone together. That looks at the arson strategy from long term. You need everyone that’s there. You need fire in the room and you need police in the room, you need people for <NOBR>by-law</NOBR> enforcement, Peter…what's Peter's last name, de Graaf, will be part of that and also Dianne Sacher from Water and Waste to develop a long term strategy in terms of</P>

<P class="p14 ft15">arson. I asked Councillor Eadie to be a part of that as well as myself in terms of the direction of the strategy that makes sense. We’d like to model it after two…well, the strategy that’s worked effectively, very effectively for the City of Winnipeg in terms of the Wats Strategy where you really have an intense focus. You strategize…you put together kind of these arsonists and as it happens you have a small amount of these people that are setting a large amount of these blazes. So if you can identify these people and really have an intense focus that work well with the Wats Strategy with the highest risk people, they were in their face all the time. What are you doing? Contact number two, three hours, so we think that looking at these and addressing these things, really approaching that in terms of the same way where you saw 80 percent reduction of the auto theft strategy, everyone gets in a room together, gets a long term strategy we think makes a lot of sense to do that going forward. And whether this is a long term I think the hot spot approach we’re having and some of them makes sense to go ahead with it. Alex Forrest from the United Firefighters had talked about the Fire Starter Program, I hope I’m saying the name right of it. But it's essentially what it is that’s a referral process and what we have seen is referrals from police and other organizations to the fire has dramatically dropped over the last number of years, so I think a part of the strategy going forward, you need to really enhance the educational component and a part of that and ensuring that you’re getting referrals in from these items. And the final point in terms of the strategy is once again, once the firefighters are going down the lanes here identifying these wastes, you need to get a real call system where things are being moved right away instead of it being reported in to 311, and three, four, five, six days later, it's removed. You’ve got to have it moved right away because that’s the issue that we’re having here. So that's the strategy going forward. I think I’m excited about it. I think it makes a lot of sense. There is a bit of discrepancy I guess between the numbers, between the police and fire numbers in terms of what constitutes a fire. We need to develop one singular number which I think the police and the fire committed to and I think this is an important strategy going forward in terms of addressing the arson issues that we are here so we are talking the bulky waste. I won't get really too much into the back and the forth of you know, whether we’re using a private contractor or <NOBR>in-house,</NOBR> that's something that the chair of Public Works is more than capable to deal with for his item. I’ve got my opinions on it, I think it’s worked out fairly well, but with that I’ll stem down and we'll have the vote.</P>

<P class="p49 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, the Mayor and I had the pleasure of opening one of Winnipeg's newest spray pads, that being at Westdale Community Centre in Charleswood. Of course, it's always about Charleswood when I get up. The hours of all spray pads are currently 11:00 to 7:00 and I’m wondering if the chair can tell us, is there any way that the hours could possibly be extended to all spray pads to maybe 8:00 or 9:00, 9:00 in the evening and what would that cost, approximately?</P>
<P class="p15 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Good question. I don’t know what the costs are. I believe we did that two or three years ago when we had extended summer into September where we kept them open later. I know there is some parameters, I believe if it’s under 22 degrees, they don’t open up. Don’t hold me to that. We could take a look at in terms of what financial costs would be there. There’s some creative way to keep it open in certain areas. Maybe you don’t do them all but you’re able to do kind of regional piece. It’s something that we could definitely take a look at. I think there is a large amount of benefits. You know, just yesterday, driving by Central Park actually, I saw just…there must have been hundreds of kids out there enjoying the splash amenities that are there, so you know, if you can keep kids and families occupied and having them more things to do in the summer, I think it’s an important thing, so we could take a look at it, see what the dollars and cents are and if there’s a way to do it in a creative way, that’s going to be…cost, that’s going to make sense for taxpayers obviously then we can take a look at it for sure.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question.</P>
<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Okay, well it’s 22 degrees out today and a high of 27. I’m wondering, it sounds like there’s a willingness to do it. How quickly could this be done?.</P>
<P class="p55 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Well we could talk to our Director, Clive Wightman. You know I mean, talking without having right information, you know. At some point, you want to…there’s a…I don’t want to say there’s a cost benefit but you want to see a much…something that that would cost because there is a limited amount of dollars that are out there. I think it’s a benefit to have these types of services there. I don’t think anyone in Council would disagree with that, but let’s see what it would cost to do certain items and how that might factor in. Does it make sense and also would like to know what other jurisdictions do right? What is Toronto doing? What is Ottawa doing? Are we close to what other areas are doing and also looking at, you know, if there’s a regional place you…maybe you don’t do every one of them but you’re able to do kind of a hub in certain areas if we want to extend some of the hours that are there, so to answer your question, I could talk to the Director and probably get some information back over the next week or so.</P>

<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>It’s more of a comment, but I was hoping that it could be accommodated by the weekend just given the heat wave and with the long weekend, but I learned a little bit about spray pads in that the water is actually recycled from a neighbouring pool, so I would hope that the cost would be minimal and that the chair would consider it, so my question is, I guess, would he be willing to expedite that?</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Yeah, as long as Clive answers his phone today I can try and get some information back. So…</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further questions for Councillor Fielding? Councillor Sharma.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, the Police Board was recently sworn in as we all know. Can the chair tell us what the next steps are for board training and meetings for the coming year?</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Fielding.</P>
<P class="p39 ft6"><SPAN class="ft5">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>I got the information through our administration that is something we can look at from Councillor Havixbeck’s question, the power point in terms of the expanded hours, so maybe we can get some information back over the next couple of days. In terms of the Police Board, it was…we were…the Police Board was…had their ceremony to swear everyone in earlier on actually late last week. And thank you for your participation Mr. Speaker and the Mayor, and we’re excited to get going forward. The schedule…we passed three things. Number one. The first step of course is to find an Executive Director. A lot of the things are laid out in terms of the Police Services Act and the procedures and</P>

<P class="p82 ft6">policies of what can and can’t happen. We’ve got kind of a template budget that was passed in the 2013 adopted Capital, but the first items, number one, is hiring an Executive Director, so we’re doing that process throughout summer, the hiring process. Through the legislation you need to be trained, and that’s part of bringing people in. We’ve got the training sessions that are happening at the end of summer where people will get, for lack of a better term, a 101 Police, where the Police will be kind of identifying and going tooth and nail through the departments in terms of where their expenditures are. We’re also having more training. We’re looking to bring in some people probably from the City of Edmonton. We were out there with the Police Services, myself and members of the Police Service I guess about two or three weeks ago. They’ve really got a good system in Edmonton going, so we’re probably bringing an Executive Director there as well as probably their Board Chair, as well as there’s a fellow that we brought in for the initial part of the training before our Board was established to talk about budgeting, to talk about accountability, to talk about communications. All that sort of stuff and also had to interact with the policing because what the Board actually does, it number one sets strategic priorities. It hires, fires, and evaluates the Chief. It sets the operating and the capital budgets that are there. It’s all that, it’s a big learning, and probably for people that, you know, aren’t in it day to day, the politicians. It’s a big learning curve for people to understand that process. We also have got to know that you know, it’s…we’re kind of at an “eyes” level, so it’s fingers in and elbows out type of thing. We’re not involved in the day to day. You can’t call up a sergeant or an inspector and say do this, do that. You know, you’ve got one member, the one member, one employee really of the Board. That’s the Chief of Police, but laying out those strategies are important. So the training is happening. There’s a conference with the Chief of Police. It’s an annual conference. It’s actually happening here in the City of Winnipeg in August, so we’ve invited all the Board members to be a part of that process going forward. There’s also kind of an event in Saskatoon that has the Canadian Association of Police Boards that are there. There’s a big learning curve that’s a part of it, so a long story short, a lot of it’s happening after the prorogue session in summer. We also would like to do a number of things. Number one, we just got an offer from the Police to do a number of things with ride alongs, to take tours of facilities. You know, Air One which is the helicopter, to everyone have a sense on some of these items, so they’re going to be learning throughout summer and the bulk of the work will really start once the Executive Director is hired, you know in terms of that, we do have a budget that we passed and once again, this is kind of a living breathing budget. We’ve allocated some money just through the money that was adopted through the operating budget. We did in 2013, and a part of that in the fall too. We’ll be working with our budget committee and developing the capital and operating budget for the Winnipeg Police. So there’s a lot of work to be done and there’s been a lot of background work and I want to thank Phil Sheegl and your team there for administrative, because it’s been a lot of work in terms of getting it together and going forward and really the big step is hiring the Executive Director so they can kind of push through the agenda and get us all organized and we’ve been kind of running it through the Clerks. The Clerks helped us quite a bit with some of the staffing component. Sherwood Armbruster has been helping out with some of the coordination of events and stuff like that, and also through my office, but it’s been difficult because, you know, you almost need a full time person doing that so we’d like to go ahead. So that’s the latest and greatest on the Police Board and it’s exciting times. You’ve got the new Chief of Police that’s there with…sorry I’m going on and on again but I’m passionate about the subject. So we’re excited to move forward with it.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p31 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>These spray pads, Mr. Speaker, that are popping up across the City, they’re wonderful. What age group are they intended for or targeted for? Is it a younger age group?</P>
<P class="p16 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Fielding: </SPAN>Kids of all ages. I’ve been there already once, right, with my daughter…daughters. You know…I think it’s probably younger, you know, in the eye of the beholder, I mean some of the items are, you know you’re going to use older as older kids and some like the young kids, ones that are there right. My daughter is 9, my oldest daughter is 9 and it’s still cool, so I guess maybe 9 and below for sure. But it really depends on what facilities that are there, and the kid, and what’s happening. It think it’s kind of a good mix between for the young kids, you know, the babies and toddlers and you know, 10 year olds and that sorts and you know, we can also go to great places. We went to Kildonan Pool, Kildonan Park Pool; I think it was last summer. It’s fantastic. They’ve done a great job there. We waited in line a long time. We were in line about an hour, but it was a hot day and there’s a splash pad that’s there, there’s everything that’s there, so they’ve done a fantastic job with it. So kids of all ages.</P>
<P class="p84 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question, Councillor Sharma.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck raised a point about extending the hours, and it’s always nice to do more Mr. Speaker, but the fact of the matter is things are tight around here, and perhaps just a suggestion to the chair is that we look at possibly <NOBR>re-jigging</NOBR> the hours, so instead of 11 to 7 was mentioned, maybe it opens at noon and we close at 8, and that way it gives families the opportunity when they get home from work to also enjoy these facilities, and perhaps we can look at extending hours next year. You know, we don’t always have a quick fix for everything around here and I’m a mother of a young child in grade 2, and 9 o’clock is far too late, I think, to be having these spray pads open till.</P>

<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Vandal.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Swandel: </SPAN>Take two minutes off the clock, please.</P>
<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>Yes, this is the 2013 regional and local street renewal program. It gives us the authority to go out and do the tender on the $7 million that the Province of Manitoba have announced for local streets. I understand all of these streets have been vetted through our collective offices, as well as our administration and this gives us the authority to go out and do it.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker</SPAN>: Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p36 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just…it goes to show and prove that what I've heard from the people…you know men cannot multitask you know, and that's clearly the case that’s been proven today. Anyway, so Mr. Speaker, this is a positive announcement: the Province coming forward with $7 million additional funding for capital budget. I know we’ve been critical in terms of the level of funding in terms of the amount that they’ve increased their...or are going to be increasing the sales tax by and the revenue that they’re going to be achieving for that, but I suppose you’ve got to say something is better than nothing. And in this case, $7 million to the Regional Local Street Renewal Program I think was very positive. The reality is, we need as much funding as we can in that fund. The amount of money that we probably need to spend is you know, it’s ten times that figure. It is ten times that figure in terms of local street renewal. We know that our, that we have now infrastructure there with regards to local streets across our entire city and it's one of the issues that I hear about all the time from my constituents. You know, can't you fix my street? Can't you fix the broken sidewalk? Can't you fix this smashed curb? You know and we know we have our local streets…if you live on a collector, you're a little luckier. You might have a ten year wait for your curb. On a local streets, it's upwards of 20 years, technically speaking in terms of curb repairs. So I mean, we really are, we have a long way to go and I think what Council's decision…what the Council’s decision back in the budget Mr. Speaker, I think was a positive one, in that we set up this fund and if you recall, we did on the basis of dedicating one percent of the property tax increase to this to start this fund off and to build upon it every year if future Councils and this Council in the next budget decide to do that again and keep moving in that direction. We have an actual 25 year plan to get us to where we need to be with the funding of local streets and to rebuild that local street system. We of course have a huge challenge with regards to our regional streets, Mr. Speaker, which you know, is you know, even a bigger issue in some ways because of the fact that the costs are just as high if not higher. It involves also our bridges, our regional bridges and the fact that it's crucial to the economic <NOBR>well-being</NOBR> of our city to have these strategic roads and regional streets open and operating safely and efficiently. So this is positive. I think the other key thing with the local street renewal reserve that we did was the rule that we put in place with the two thirds majority requirement that it takes two thirds to take the funding out. I think the transparency was regards to that and the fact that folks know that the money is going in, it’s going to be there in the future. It’s going to be there in the future to fund that and future increases are done on one percent basis in every year into the future then that fund will build and build and build and so hopefully, this Council and future Councils will have the will and the discipline to follow through with that commitment to our local street renewal especially when they start to see the fun you know getting larger in number and scope. And it gets tempting to say, okay, let's move that money here or move that money there, I pray and hope that that would not be the case that we will stick to the plan because we know the reality is and this is going to be the tough part, Mr. Speaker, is that as folks start to see more and more streets getting fixed which will happen, that it will be tough, right? Because then, what about my streets, why is my street not getting fixed? And that’s going to be the challenge, right, is to communicate and say, “Well, you know, unfortunately, it</P>

<P class="p66 ft15">didn't happen overnight. We’re trying to get to the poorest ones first, and then to the fair and to the good to get it to where we need to go.” So that's the challenge and you know it's a tough and but we’re…you know, for the first time Mr. Speaker, an issue which I think many of us for a long time thought was insurmountable that we couldn't address this issue that it was just massive, that it was impossible to solve. I think you know we have a plan now and if we stick to it, we can solve it and we just have to ensure that we do that, Mr. Speaker. And so I want to thank the Provincial Government, my friends over on Broadway for earmarking this badly needed funding. I don’t have many, maybe one friend there, I should remove the “s” on friends. Anyway, for earmarking this funding and encourage them, and I want to recognize Councillor Eadie who I know went actually to the budget consultation that the Minister had, the one meeting he had in the city. I know on top of all the consultations we’re doing. But anyway, but no, one is better than none, right? So, and he spoke out and he spoke passionately, I know and he brought his map of his ward and you know I think you know, it goes to show that you know you can have an impact and impact on public policy. I want to thank Councillor Eadie for that effort. I know he’s been passionate about it so those are my comments, Mr. Speaker. I’ll be supporting the clause.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">Mr. Speaker: <SPAN class="ft2">Mayor Katz.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mayor Katz: </SPAN>Thank you. I will most definitely be supporting the clause. It's a great initiative and I think it's wonderful that the Province has matched the funds. The reason why I want to speak, Mr. Speaker, is on a related issue to this. Yours truly and I believe all members of Council received an <NOBR>e-mail,</NOBR> critical of our department for not getting this stuff out and getting it tendered already and I think not only was that not warranted, but was totally unfair and was ridiculous, considering the facts of this was actually made official by the Province at the end of April, okay? For someone to criticize our department for not getting it out there and getting it tendered, like that, is just unfair and I only want to put that on the record because I believe every member of Council got that and we have basically responded and let them know that that was unwarranted and not fair, end of story. So I just want to say that.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Steen. You’re next.</P>
<P class="p31 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Steen: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to add my support to this too. I’m very grateful that we're getting more money for this, but you don't have to drive many streets in the city to know that it's one of the most important things we have to do for our city and I appreciate Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Mayor driving this and I just want to throw my support in there, too. Thank you very much.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Eadie.</P>
<P class="p39 ft13"><SPAN class="ft12">Councillor Eadie: </SPAN>Yes, thank you Speaker Nordman and thank you to Councillor Wyatt. I couldn't bring a big enough map along with me to show all the very poor streets. So I just wanted to acknowledge that first of all, yeah, that yeah, $7 million that's about half of the new money that we put in on our plan which is you know it’s good. Every little bit helps and I would like to point as well though that but this $7 million is being spent all over the city in our older neighbourhoods. I know Councillor Wyatt, there is a street there that’s needed some serious repair in your ward for quite some time. I think it was scheduled under the $7 million and I know that they are all over the city and I would also mention that the how come not my street first has already started and when you have 60 percent of your streets failing in West Kildonan and I think we have this year in West Kildonan, this is a water waste issue but we have on those same roads that are deteriorating quickly, we have a whole bunch of drainage basins. We have sink holes all over and it seems like there’s way more has appeared this year than in the past and that’s probably because we’ve had a bit more water I think this year so far with the late spring melt and stuff. But…and yes, to be fair, I you know, there’s always room to improve your processes in terms of getting and tendering out contracts to do repair and when you do find it, you have a surplus to actually look at further streets as I think Councillor Havixbeck has pointed out that there was…you know it cost a little bit less and so that means that there must be some success in our tendering process in…when we do have surplus left and we can do more streets but yeah, I mean to be fair, you know, April, it's really hard. I know that working with the streets engineer in my ward, you know, I know they’re working many hours to try to get everything together, put this together, make sure that we are dealing with it properly. And so I wouldn't be so critical of that tendering process but if there are any improvements, it's good to consider some of those. So anyway, yeah, I’ll be of course voting for this absolutely and I’m looking forward to hopefully next year and maybe. Well, I think actually I should point out I think the regional streets</P>

<P class="p14 ft15">in our city are a really big problem and technically, while I thank the Province for the local street, I didn't really expect them to put money into local, but really, our regional streets are in real serious need of repair as well as I’ve been told and you have a lot more people driving on them. Hopefully, we can convince the Province next year to chip into a bigger plan to solve some of those problems. So thank you.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Havixbeck.</P>
<P class="p35 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I support this $7 million budget amendment towards more streets in Winnipeg, however, I can't support some of what has been said by some other Councillors. I recently went to public works and I raised the issue that the bids awarded, came up to, according to my calculations based on bids awarded on the City's website, about 4.2 million under what was budgeted for this year and that's exactly the one percent tax increase that some councillors professed that we need. So I’m not convinced that we actually needed it if we are so much under budget, but my pressing on this is that timing is everything, and we are at the beginning, somewhat, of the construction season and if pricing is going to be at this level we should maximize our opportunities and perhaps get out some more bids and use up that 4.2 million. It does us no good sitting on the books when we’ve already collected it from people. So I’ve raised that question subsequently at Finance Committee and I’m hoping that we get the answers, but. It seems to me that if we can get prices at the 2009 or so we are getting better value for taxpayers and we’re getting more streets done which is what we’ve all been saying is needed and how many of us wouldn't like a back lane or another street or sidewalk done? I guess my question would be and maybe the chair could address this in his closing comments, are we certain our administration can get tenders out and get bids in and evaluated and the work done this year on the 7 million? That would be my question. I believe we also should have all the information and at our Finance Committee, I asked the CFO, how much is this PST increase of 14 percent going to cost the City of Winnipeg and his response that on an annual basis, it's somewhere in the 1.5 to $1.8 million. That's very significant when the Province has given us $7 million. It's almost a net of 5.5, really. And I think that all Councillors should know that information and be mindful of that. So again, just some other information to put on the table, I do support the $7 million and am appreciative because it will mean better streets for Winnipeggers, hopefully.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Any further comments? If none, Councillor Vandal to close.</P>
<P class="p36 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Councillor Vandal: </SPAN>I’ll start with Councillor Havixbeck first because that’s the freshest in my memory. I think while it may be true that there is a notionally a surplus on the work that's already been tendered, we are in the middle of tendering $7 million worth of work that’s going to close very soon, so it would be prudent to see what these tenders, how these tenders end up before we actually say there is a surplus. It may be that this $7 million worth of work is going to cost us more. I really don't know and I don't think anyone knows until those tenders close. So while it's worthwhile keeping that in our scope, let's wait to see how these tenders conclude. And yes, I’m led to believe we can get into the ground this year for some of these, for these projects, unless someone has information otherwise. I’m led to believe it's doable and this is a good news story all the way around. This is a street that would not have otherwise gotten done, had the Province not committed this money and I think the key note here is that our one percent residential street reserve that we’ve created, it actually I think spurred the Province on to spend some more to match our dollars and I think that's an incredibly positive project as Councillor Wyatt has elaborated. We needed a <NOBR>two-thirds</NOBR> majority to use that money for anything other than residential streets and at the end of ten years, if we stick with the program, one percent per year at the end of ten years, that’s going to be $300 million of new money going to residential streets over and above the regular money that we spend and what the Province spends, so it's taking a chunk out of our burden on residential streets and unfortunately we still need more for bridges, for regional streets and…but nevertheless it's a positive story and it's the sort of <NOBR>co-operation</NOBR> that can occur between the two levels of government and I hope that we can work as positively on completing rapid transit to the University of Manitoba. Thank you.</P>
<P class="p17 ft15"><SPAN class="ft14">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Okay, that concludes the comments on the June 18th Item 3, Regional Local Street Renewal. All those in favour? Opposed? Carried. We have one motion which is an automatic referral regarding Handi Transit so we'll put that forward from Councillor Eadie and Councillor Smith.</P>

<P class="p75 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p17 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Sharma: </SPAN>Mr. Speaker, the Forks Renewal Corporation and the City of Winnipeg hosted public workshops recently to help develop a vision for the rail side lands in parcel 4. Can the chair give us an update on the turnout and input we may have received there?</P>
<P class="p25 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Pagtakhan.</P>
<P class="p16 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Pagtakhan: </SPAN>Yes, thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I thank Councillor Sharma for the question. Recently there was an advertisement for public open houses, public consultations for the…parcel 4 and rail side yards development, completes the report that 40 people attended last Wednesday’s public consultation. There’s also a website that the Forks has put up. I’ll send it to all members of Council, and it allows the public to provide an <NOBR>on-line</NOBR> presence for the public consultation. They’ve got photos, some pictures and various options that the public can choose. They can also provide written feedback on some of the options and their own ideas. This whole initiative Mr. Speaker, I want to say, is going to be an <NOBR>on-going</NOBR> process. Last week was the first of the public consultations. There are, like I said, the <NOBR>on-line</NOBR> public consultations as well as more public consultations occurring later this fall and throughout the winter. So I’ll just leave it at that for now.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Thanks, Councillor Pagtakhan. Any further questions for Downtown Development? Seeing none, we will move on to Finance. We have no report on Finance, no <NOBR>by-laws.</NOBR> Do we have question period for Finance? Councillor Havixbeck.</P>

<P class="p53 ft1">QUESTION PERIOD</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I think you were trying to not see my hand there Mr. Speaker.</P>
<P class="p94 ft1">Councillor Eadie: <SPAN class="ft2">I didn’t see it. (laughter)</SPAN></P>
<P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Very good Ross! Councillor Havixbeck, proceed.</P>
<P class="p24 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>I’d like to ask the Chair of Finance about his proposed motion related to these “Wyatt Weekends”. Is the Chair already aware that there is a furlough program within the City of Winnipeg that most directors actually choose not to allow staff to voluntarily take leave of?</P>
<P class="p47 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p58 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Actually no, I wasn’t aware of that. And I want to thank the Councillor for bringing that to my attention and hopefully we will get some answers with regards to that and see what we can do. I’m…you know…Mr. Speaker, you know, we’re trying to find solutions. I mentioned…I spoke just a few minutes ago positively about the Provincial Government so I don’t want to talk differently at this point, but maybe I’ll just add this, and that is that, you know, I mean the change with regards to the Provincial Sales Tax, I think, is having a big impact in terms of the <NOBR>fall-out</NOBR> on, not just the City, but all municipalities in this Province because of the fact that we have been lobbying for a long time and it’s not been a secret…lobbying for a long time for one percent of the Sales Tax to assist us with the financial challenges we have including our infrastructure challenges, and so you know, I think we have to look at different options, and that’s one option, but it may not be the right option. It may be the right option depending on how it can work, and anyway, that’s just one option that’s available…possibly available to us to help us address the $74 million shortfall that we’re trying to close and we’ll need to close with regards to balancing our budget for 2014.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Second question?</P>
<P class="p95 ft21"><SPAN class="ft20">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>Yes thank you. During the budget process, the chair of Finance, who is also the chair of the Alternate Service Delivery Committee, said that the ASD unit was essential for this budget, and in early February, very few days after the actual budget was passed, which is now five months ago, hiring ads were run in the careers section of</P>

<P class="p96 ft2">the newspaper for ASD professionals. Can the chair tell us perhaps what the status of this hiring is and what savings this ASD unit has found?</P>
<P class="p97 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>I can tell the Councillor that yes that is correct, there was a budget that set aside for accelerated ASD and that work is under way right now. I don’t have details in terms of giving you right now at my fingertips the targeted savings but that will come forward in different initiatives. There are three individuals who have been hired on a contract basis with the City and they’re not FTEs but they’re three individuals hired on contract basis to work on these initiatives and to bring forward, but we…you know, we have…if we’re raising property taxes, I think it’s crucial to at the same time do everything we can to find savings within our organization and find efficiencies and you’re absolutely right Councillor. That’s a commitment we made in the last budget and you know, like any large organization, government organization, there’s sometimes resistance internally just because the nature of the organization is that. I don’t care what government it is, and what level of government. So that work is underway and you know, it’s under…being worked on through our CFO, the Chief Financial Officer of the City and his staff, and so hopefully we’ll have other initiatives that will come in the fall by the looks of it in terms of bringing forward savings to the operations of the City.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Last question.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4"><SPAN class="ft3">Councillor Havixbeck: </SPAN>At our last Council meeting, I asked the Chair of the Standing Policy Committee on Protection and Community Services what the status of affordable, secure parking is for Winnipeg Police officers at the new P.S.B. The chair told me that the chair of Finance actually oversaw the Parking Authority, and since that meeting, another off- duty police officer has been assaulted. That’s two in the last three months plus an admin person from the Police Services. Can the chair tell me what is being done to create affordable secure parking when police are actually relocated? The current rate that I’m hearing is $200 a month and this is completely unattainable for an officer who may be earning only $40,000 a year.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Councillor Wyatt.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Councillor Wyatt: </SPAN>Yeah, I mean this is…you know, I appreciate the Councillor’s question. I know it’s a serious one, so if she doesn’t mind if I can look into this and then get back to her I would do that. Thanks.</P>
<P class="p68 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Mr. Speaker: </SPAN>Fair enough. Any further question? Seeing none. I will entertain a motion from Councillor Steen to adjourn. All those in favour? Have a good long weekend.</P>
<P class="p57 ft1">Council adjourned at 11:36 p.m.</P>
